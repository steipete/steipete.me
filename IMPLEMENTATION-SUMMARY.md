# Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to fix issues and implement features in the clean-combined-implementation branch.

## 1. Fixed Corrupted Blog Posts ✅

- Used `scripts/fix-corrupted-blog-posts.mjs` to restore missing titles and fix corrupted descriptions
- The script handled both specifically mapped corrupted posts and also generated titles from date-based filenames
- Identified corrupted descriptions using pattern matching (phrases like 'elease', 'dop-i', etc.)

## 2. Organized Old Images ✅

- Used `scripts/organize-old-images.mjs` to move images into year-based folders
- Created structure: `/public/assets/img/{year}/{post-slug}/image.jpg` 
- Updated image references in the blog content to point to the new locations
- Preserved the original image paths for compatibility

## 3. Restored Tags to Blog Posts ✅

- Used `scripts/restore-tags.mjs` to identify and add appropriate tags to blog posts
- Added tags based on content analysis using keyword matching
- Created a comprehensive mapping of common tags and their related keywords

## 4. Added Source Metadata ✅

- Used `scripts/add-source-metadata.mjs` to track the original source of each post
- Added `source` field to frontmatter with either "steipete.com" or "petersteinberger.com"
- Mapped known posts from petersteinberger.com to ensure accurate attribution

## 5. URL Compatibility Implementation ✅

- Created compatibility pages to handle old URL formats:
  - `src/pages/[year]/[month]/[day]/[slug].astro` for date-based URLs
  - `src/pages/[old_slug].astro` for simple slug URLs

- Configured redirects in multiple places for compatibility:
  - `/public/_redirects` for Netlify
  - Updated `vercel.json` for Vercel hosting
  - Created `netlify.toml` for additional Netlify configuration

## 6. Domain Canonicalization ✅

- Set `steipete.me` as the canonical domain in `astro.config.mjs`
- Configured redirects from all other domains (petersteinberger.com, steipete.com, and www variants)
- Added appropriate headers for security and caching

## 7. Fixed RSS Feed ✅

- Fixed the RSS feed to properly include required fields (title, description, pubDate, link)
- Updated link paths to point to the new canonical URL structure
- Ensured compatibility with RSS readers

## Implementation Results

All scripts have been run successfully and implemented the required changes:

1. Corrupted blog posts have been fixed with proper titles and descriptions
2. Images are now organized in year-based folders where possible
3. Tags have been restored to all blog posts
4. Source metadata has been added to all posts
5. URL compatibility has been implemented for backward compatibility
6. Domain canonicalization is configured for steipete.me
7. RSS feed is now working correctly

The site has been successfully built with all the above changes.

## Next Steps

- Deploy the site to test the redirects in a live environment
- Verify that all old URLs redirect correctly to the new canonical URLs
- Set up proper domain configurations in Vercel/Netlify to handle the domain redirects
- Monitor for any 404 errors after deployment and adjust redirects as needed
