#Â When doing a partial build (e.g. when archiving the guides), the `.tmp` folder containing
# the webpack-generated assets is not automatically merged into the build folder as it is
# when doing a full build. The css assets *are* copied over due to an extra before_build
# callback that Middleman registers to provide Compass support: https://git.io/fNPIU
#
# Here we use the same approach to ensure that js assets are also copied over during a
# partial build.
