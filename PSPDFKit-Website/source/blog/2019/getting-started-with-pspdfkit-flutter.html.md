## What Is Flutter?

Flutter is a relatively new hybrid technology (compared to Cordova, Xamarin, and React Native, which are all at least a few years old) and it‚Äôs made by Google. According to Google, ‚ÄúFlutter allows you to build beautiful native apps on iOS and Android from a single codebase.‚Äù

Flutter uses Google‚Äôs own programming language, Dart, which is somewhat similar to JavaScript and has built-in support for type safety. Flutter has some great features ‚Äî like hot reload, which allows you to quickly reload an app and view changes without having to restart the app ‚Äî and it comes with a modern reactive framework and lots of widgets.

When we first looked into [using Flutter][how i got started with flutter blog post], we enjoyed the development experience, and our experimenting resulted in the PSPDFKit Flutter wrapper. In this post, I‚Äôll talk about how to get started with [PSPDFKit Flutter][pspdfkit flutter repo]. I‚Äôll also discuss how easy and fast it is to get our sample project running on both Android and iOS.

There are four simple steps, which you‚Äôll find below.

### Step 1: Install the Flutter SDK and the IDEs

Before we get started, we need to make sure that the [Flutter SDK][install flutter], [Android Studio][], and [Xcode][] are all installed.

> **‚ÑπÔ∏è Note:** If you‚Äôre following this tutorial on a single platform, it‚Äôs not necessary to install the other platform‚Äôs IDE. For example, if you want to run the sample project on Android, it‚Äôs unnecessary to install Xcode.

### Step 2: Clone the PSPDFKit Flutter Repository

You need to download or clone the [open source repository][pspdfkit flutter repo] for PSPDFKit Flutter:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:PSPDFKit/pspdfkit-flutter.git
```

### Step 3: Download and Set Up PSPDFKit

Then, you need to [download][trial] and set up PSPDFKit for Android and iOS.

#### Setting Up PSPDFKit for Android

For Android, you need to create a local property file in `pspdfkit-flutter/example/android/local.properties` and specify the following properties:

```local.properties
sdk.dir=/path/to/your/Android/sdk
flutter.sdk=/path/to/your/flutter/sdk
pspdfkit.password=YOUR_PASSWORD_GOES_HERE
flutter.buildMode=debug
```

#### Setting Up PSPDFKit for iOS

For iOS, replace `YOUR_COCOAPODS_KEY_GOES_HERE` with your CocoaPods key in `pspdfkit-flutter/example/iOS/Podfile`, like so:

```ruby
 ...
 target 'Runner' do
   pod 'PSPDFKit', podspec:'https://customers.pspdfkit.com/cocoapods/YOUR_COCOAPODS_KEY_GOES_HERE/pspdfkit/latest.podspec'
 ...
```

> **‚ÑπÔ∏è Important:** If you‚Äôre an existing customer, you can find the password, CocoaPods key, and license keys in your [customer portal][]. Otherwise, if you don‚Äôt already have PSPDFKit, [sign up for our 60-day trial][trial] and you will receive an email with the instructions to get started.

Now, `cd` into the `pspdfkit-flutter/example` directory, and run `flutter emulators --launch <EMULATOR_ID>` to launch the desired emulator, like so:

```bash
cd pspdfkit-flutter/example
flutter emulators --launch <EMULATOR_ID>
```

> **üí° Tip:** Optionally, you can repeat this step to launch multiple emulators.

### Step 4: Build and Run

The app is ready to start! Run `flutter run -d all` to deploy the PSPDFKit Flutter example on all your connected devices:

```bash
flutter run -d all
```

## Conclusion

Flutter allows you to run our example from a single codebase on both Android and iOS. In our example app, the logic is in `main.dart`, and it contains very little platform-specific code.

Our wrapper, [PSPDFKit Flutter][pspdfkit flutter repo], is open source, and we encourage and welcome [pull request contributions][pspdfkit flutter repo pull requests] from the community.
