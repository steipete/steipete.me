At PSPDFKit, we are huge fans and early adopters of [WebAssembly][] and [Emscripten][].

Thanks to these two technologies, we have brought the core of our PDF framework, which is comprised of 500,000+ lines of C and C++, into the browser!

Recently we had the pleasure of speaking to [Alon Zakai][], one of the creators of [WebAssembly][] and the creator of [Emscripten][], a toolchain for compiling to asm.js and WebAssembly that lets you run C and C++ on the web.

We had a conversation about what WebAssembly is, what problems it can solve, how we use it in [PSPDFKit for Web][], and why you should probably be using it in your next project! We also talked a little about the future of WebAssembly, some of its current challenges, and some interesting new developments.

Below is the recording. We hope you enjoy it!
