My name is Luna and I am one of the Web Engineers here at PSPDFKit. I, like a lot of folks in our industry, prefer to work from home. Yes, I’ve tried working in an office and in coworking spaces, but as an autistic disabled person, I am simply more productive when I’m unencumbered by commutes and the social expectations that come with working in a shared space.

For most of my career, I have been working from home from multiple cities around the world and at multiple jobs. Until last year, my “remote workspace” was just a 13" MacBook Pro, but as this wasn’t ergonomic, it caused me a lot of neck and wrist pain. As a result, I decided to finally take the time to research and invest in a workspace that would be more comfortable and healthier for me to work at for eight hours a day.

Both my partner and I work from our two-bedroom apartment. Since he needs more space as an artist, my office is situated in our master bedroom and his is in the other room. My desk is a 1-by-2.5-meter dining room table that I got secondhand from a nearby coffee shop that was closing down. I really enjoy having such a large work surface since it allows me to be less cluttered.

The chair I use is an [ErgoChair 2][ergo-chair] from Autonomous. As someone with chronic pain, I needed a chair that wouldn’t cause a flareup as a result of sitting for most of the day, and I consider the chair to be a worthwhile investment. I’ve had it for more than a year and a half, and it’s still as comfortable as it was on the first day. Despite the quality of the chair, sitting all day can still be a pain. Literally. So I’m considering buying a sit-stand desk to give me more options.

The computer that powers my work is a docked 15" MacBook Pro from 2018. It packs a 6-core i7 processor, a Radeon 555X graphics card, 32&nbsp;GB of RAM, and 256&nbsp;GB of storage. I’ve also wrapped it in a beautiful [Black Marble dbrand skin][dbrand-skin] to give it some personality. It gets the job done, and it only sounds like a jet taking off when I’m compiling one of PSPDFKit’s codebases.

## Now We’re Getting to the Good Stuff!

The keyboard I use is an imported HHKB Type-S with lubed key switches and a few custom key caps. From what I’ve seen, you can either import it from Japan or buy it secondhand on forums like [r/mechmarket][mechmarket]. With shipping and import fees, it was...expensive (_lists budget: $250 food, $1,000 rent, $200 utilities, $50,000,000,000 custom keyboards. Someone please help me budget, my family is dying_). However, it makes typing enjoyable, so I think it was worth the money.

Loud music helps me focus, and I’m really happy with my audio setup. For speakers, I have a pair of [PreSonus Eris E5][presonus-e5]s that are plugged into a [Focusrite Scarlett 2i2][focusrite] audio interface. When I need to be quiet, I listen to music using my limited edition matte gray [Audio Technica ATH-M50x][m50x] headphones.

I have purchased and used so many Thunderbolt 3/USB-C docks, and all of them stopped working after a few months. After 11 or 12 “cheap” $100–200 docks, I decided to splurge on the most high-end one I could find — an [OWC Thunderbolt 3 Dock][owc-tb3] — and so far, it’s worked great. Knock on wood, but I am confident this one will work for a long time, and at a cost of $400, it had better.

My monitor is a [Dell U3419W 34-inch ultrawide][u3419w]. It’s 3440x1440 pixels, has USB-C, and sports a color-accurate IPS panel. I’ve only had this for a month (because my last ultrawide kicked the bucket), but in that short amount of time, it’s been awesome. I absolutely love that it’s one cable from the monitor to the Thunderbolt 3 dock.

Finally, I use a [Logitech MX Master 2S][logi-2s] mouse, a [Logitech C925e][webcam] webcam, and a [Twelve South Bookarc][bookarc] for propping up my laptop.

That’s all for now folks. I would love to hear your thoughts about my setup and see pictures of yours. Feel free to reach out [over on my Twitter][twitter].
