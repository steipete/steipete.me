## Improved Font Rendering

![font-rendering](/images/blog/2019/pspdfkit-windows-2-1/font-rendering.png)

We overhauled our font rendering in order to improve glyph positioning and kerning for all fonts. In particular, fonts based on non-Latin alphabets such as Arabic and Chinese will see considerable improvements.

## Final Notes

Along with the new font renderer, this release also includes a number of bug fixes and some minor improvements. For a complete list of changes, see the [changelog][].
