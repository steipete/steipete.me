Introducing PSPDFKit for Web 2016.3. 2016.3 is our last release of the year. With this release, we brought you an integrated dashboard that makes it easier to see what's going on in your production installation and to improve your developer experience.

## New Dashboard

A lot of our customers asked for a handy way to see what's going on in their running instance and to interact with the server in development.

Previously developers had to use the [HTTP backend API](https://pspdfkit.com/guides/server/current/server-api/overview/) directly if they wanted to manage documents.

With this release there's no need to use `curl` any more, instead we've built a brand-new React-powered dashboard.

## The year ahead

Since we started building PSPDFKit for Web early this year, we've been listening to customer feedback so we could shape PSPDFKit for Web to their needs.

We released the first production version just this month and we're commited to continue bringing the PSPDFKit experience to all platforms. You can always reach us at web@pspdfkit.com to discuss your requirements.
