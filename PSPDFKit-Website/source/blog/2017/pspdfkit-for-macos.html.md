Today, we are happy to introduce our newest addition to the PSPDF family,
[PSPDFKit for macOS](https://pspdfkit.com/macos/).

The Mac has always been, and continues to be, near and dear to our hearts. It
is where we as professionals spend our days, sometimes even nights, to get our
job done. Many of the apps we use require advanced PDF viewing and processing
capabilities. As Mac developers and users, we value quality. It is because of
this value that we decided to take the core of our industry leading iOS
framework and bring it to macOS.

[PSPDFKit for macOS](https://pspdfkit.com/macos/) is what we call BYOV â€” bring
your own views. It enables you to write your custom UI and PDF workflows on top
of our advanced PDF processing technology. The same level of performance,
stability, and features you've come to expect on iOS, now on macOS.

PSPDFKit is a cross-platform solution for everything related to handling PDFs
in your apps and services. The macOS version offers great interoperability with
PSPDFKit for iOS, Android, the web, and future PSPDFKit products. By providing
just our core, we think we cover many of the use-cases particularly of interest
to macOS developers, including manipulating PDF documents and filling out forms
programmatically.

Just like the other frameworks in the PSPDFKit family, PSPDFKit for macOS comes
with [thorough documentation and examples](https://pspdfkit.com/guides/macos/current/) illustrating how to use
it, and a complete [API reference](https://pspdfkit.com/api/macos/).

Download [PSPDFKit for macOS](https://pspdfkit.com/try/) today and give it
a try.

## Feedback Welcomed

This first release is just the beginning. We are currently in the process of
defining the roadmap for PSPDFKit for macOS. Prioritizing what is most
important and what to tackle next is particularly challenging for a desktop
SDK, where the overall market is much smaller, yet the number of possible
use-cases much larger.

Therefore, we are eager to hear your feedback, suggestions, and ideas that will
help shape the future of PSPDFKit for macOS. This in turn will enable you to
deliver the best possible experience for your customers.

Please [get in touch](https://pspdfkit.com/support/request).
