The year 2014 just started but we've been mighty busy tweaking and improving our PDF SDK. PSPDFKit 3.3 adds support for the upcoming iOS 7.1, can read and verify digital signatures and has a super long list of big and small improvements.

## Visual Design and Icons

## Digital Signatures
Many business transactions, including financial, legal, and other regulated transactions, require high assurance when signing documents.
PSPDFKit Complete and Enterprise can now verify these digital signatures on signature form fields.
We also support adding custom root certificates and custom handlers to verify additional signature formats.

## Localization
PSPDFKit now ships with **English, Chinese, Korean, Japanese, French, Spanish, Russian, Italian, Danish, German, Portuguese and Brazilian Portuguese** localizations. Missing your language? Tell us, and we might further expand the set. Of course, it's also straightforward to add your own localization files.

## All-New Multimedia Gallery

If you want to [spice up your documents with some videos or images](https://github.com/PSPDFKit/PSPDFKit-Demo/wiki/Adding-a-Gallery-to-a-PDF), 3.3 ships with a brand-new, smart, zoomable image gallery that can display images, videos and audio files from local or remote sources, has smart content prefetching and uses a snappy fullscreen view that allows subtitles similar to the Facebook app.
