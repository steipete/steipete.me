In a previous article, I discussed simple options for [opening a PDF in your web app without JavaScript][pdf in web app], along with how to [render PDF files in the browser with PDF.js][pdf.js]. Today, I’m going one step further and will examine how we can open a PDF in a React application on the web.

[React][] is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces on the web as well as a multitude of other systems, including iOS and Android. In this article, we’ll use `react-dom` and focus on the web. If you’re looking for a React Native guide, [we’ve also got you covered][react native guide].

## Getting Started

For this article, we’ll be using a library by Wojciech Maj called [`react-pdf`][]. If you use your favorite online search engine, you’ll likely find [another library][another react library] with the same name, created by Diego Muracciole. However, at the time of writing, the latter is only used to create PDFs.

`react-pdf` gives us a React-based component API for opening PDF files and rendering them using [PDF.js][].

To get started, we’ll set up a minimal React application using [Create React App][]. This allows us to get started without having to think about configuration (alternatively, you can take a look at the fantastic [React documentation][] and learn about ways to get started without using any additional tooling). To do this, we simply run the following:

[==

```yarn
yarn create react-app pdf-app
cd pdf-app
yarn start
```

```npm
npx create-react-app pdf-app
cd pdf-app
npm start
```

==]

After these commands are run, your favorite browser should open, and you should see the boilerplate generated by Create React App.

## Rendering a PDF

To start rendering our first PDF, we begin by placing the file we want to render inside the `./public` directory of the `pdf-app` folder. This ensures we can access the file from the web.

Next, we add `react-pdf` to our project:

[==

```yarn
yarn add react-pdf
```

```npm
npm install react-pdf
```

==]

`react-pdf` comes with two components that are of interest when rendering a PDF: `Document` and `Page`. `Document` is used to open a PDF and is a mandatory part. Within the document, we can mount pages, which are used to render the PDF page. To integrate this into our example project, we’re going to open `./src/App.js` and replace its contents with the following:

```jsx
import React, { Component } from "react";
import { Document, Page } from "react-pdf";

export default class App extends Component {
  state = { numPages: null, pageNumber: 1 };

  onDocumentLoadSuccess = ({ numPages }) => {
    this.setState({ numPages });
  };

  goToPrevPage = () =>
    this.setState(state => ({ pageNumber: state.pageNumber - 1 }));
  goToNextPage = () =>
    this.setState(state => ({ pageNumber: state.pageNumber + 1 }));

  render() {
    const { pageNumber, numPages } = this.state;

    return (
      <div>
        <nav>
          <button onClick={this.goToPrevPage}>Prev</button>
          <button onClick={this.goToNextPage}>Next</button>
        </nav>

        <div style={{ width: 600 }}>
          <Document
            file="/example.pdf"
            onLoadSuccess={this.onDocumentLoadSuccess}
          >
            <Page pageNumber={pageNumber} width={600} />
          </Document>
        </div>

        <p>
          Page {pageNumber} of {numPages}
        </p>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

This is already enough to render a PDF in React.

Since `react-pdf` does not come with a user interface, we have built our own. In the example above, we render two buttons to navigate the page within the `<nav>` elements and show the total progress on the bottom. The result looks something like this:

<video src="/images/blog/2018/open-pdf-in-react/react-pdf.mp4" width="100%" loop muted playsinline data-controller="video" data-video-autoplay="true"></video>

## Advanced Features

By default, `react-pdf` enables important features of [PDF.js][] — including the text layer, which allows us to copy and paste text from the PDF. However, one feature that is disabled is the dedicated annotation layer. In a PDF, [annotations][what are annotations] provide additional information and enable the use of hyperlinks. In our example PDF, we have a hyperlink on the first page that we want to enable as well. To do this, we have to import an additional file for the CSS that is needed:

```js
import "react-pdf/dist/Page/AnnotationLayer.css";
```

<img alt="Screenshot of a PDF page with a link annotation" width="363" src="/images/blog/2018/open-pdf-in-react/links.png">

Another improvement we can make is to use [web workers][] so that our PDFs can be rendered in another thread, in order to keep our main window responsive at all times. Luckily, `react-pdf` comes with pre-built support for adding this option to [Webpack][], and Create React App uses Webpack under the hood.

To enable web workers, all we need to do is replace our input line with the following:

```diff
import React, { Component } from "react";
- import { Document, Page } from "react-pdf";
+ import { Document, Page } from "react-pdf/dist/entry.webpack";
import "react-pdf/dist/Page/AnnotationLayer.css";
```

You can see the worker in action by inspecting the page with your favorite developer tools.

## Conclusion

With just a few lines of code, we were able to utilize the full power of PDF.js in a React application. This is a great way to get started and will certainly help boost your business.

We’ve already discussed the underlying technology in great detail in [the previous post][pdf.js]. I suggest that you look through that to get an understanding of the pros and cons when working with PDF.js.

If you’re looking for a solution that includes a fully responsive and customizable user interface, support for various annotation types, interactive forms and signatures, mobile support, persistence management, and many more features, we have a solution for you. We at PSPDFKit work on the [next generation][] of [PDF viewers for the web][pspdfkit for web]. Together with [PSPDFKit Instant][], we offer an enterprise-ready PDF solution for web browsers and other platforms, along with industry-leading first-class support included with every plan.
