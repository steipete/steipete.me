During the episode, John and Peter talk about the origins of PSPDFKit and how it started from just a one-off project for a client while Steinberger was waiting for his US visa to come through, evolved into a hobby project, and ultimately grew into the 40-person company that it is today. They go on to discuss some of the difficulties of building and maintaining a large framework project, how the iOS team works with Radar, and the challenges that Peter has in common with other companies producing a closed source SDK.
