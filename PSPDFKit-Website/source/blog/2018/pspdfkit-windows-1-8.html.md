With our new stamp annotations, you can place stamps on a PDF with predefined stamps like Approved or Accepted. We also allow you to create custom stamp annotations with our stamp annotation builder UI.

## Bookmarks Sidebar

When you want to remember a certain page in your document, the easiest way to do this is to add a bookmark. You can easily create a bookmark in your PDF via either the UI or our API.
