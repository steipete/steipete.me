### Job Description

We're looking to hire a Mac developer to join our team working on PSPDFKit, the leading PDF framework for iOS and Android. Our framework is used by many companies in countless different settings, which brings unique challenges, especially around API design and writing robust code. We have plans for the Mac and we need someone who speaks AppKit as first language.

#### You will…

*   Lead a new project in Swift 3, Objective-C and some C++.
*   Make architectural decisions that will impact thousands of apps for years.
*   Write code that's readable, [cross-platform](/blog/2016/a-pragmatic-approach-to-cross-platform/), well documented and has meaningful [tests](/blog/2016/continuous-ios-code-coverage-with-jenkins-and-slather/) so shipping new releases can happen often and without fear.
*   Help and improve our [PDF Viewer app](/viewer) written in Swift 3.
*   Build new features and fix existing issues.
*   [Spend time to get things “right”, not to hack something up quick.](/blog/2016/writing-good-bug-reports/)
*   Collaborate daily with the whole team (Android, iOS, Core, Support, Backend, Design) using Slack, GitHub and Google Hangouts.

* * *

#### Our ideal candidate

*   Is located somewhere within 6 hours +/- of the UTC timezone.
*   Has good communication skills and understands the importance of team cohesion.
*   Has a deep and intimate understanding about Objective-C and Cocoa.
*   Has worked on frameworks or open sourced components before.
*   Enjoys designing components with a clear and simple API.
*   Has experience with Swift, Objective-C but also knowledge of C and C++.
*   Has a pragmatic approach to problem-solving.
*   Has a good command of English for writing documentation and occasional blog posts.
*   Has worked remotely and understands the different challenges of a distributed team.

* * *

#### What you get

*   Room for personal and professional development.
*   A motivated team and a thriving work culture.
*   Numerous planned company events throughout the year.
*   The freedom to set up your ideal work environment.
*   Flexible working hours and vacation policy.

* * *

#### You should include these in your application

*   A writeup explaining who you are as a programmer. Sample questions you might want to address: How'd you get started? What projects have you enjoyed working on? Which have you disliked? What motivates you? What surprising things have you learned about yourself since starting to program?
*   A piece of code that does something you find interesting, and an explanation of why. (It doesn't have to be your own code.)
*   Links to online profiles you use (Github, Twitter, etc).
*   A description of your work history (whether as a resume, LinkedIn profile, or prose).
