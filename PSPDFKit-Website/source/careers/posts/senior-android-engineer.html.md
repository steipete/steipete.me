### Job Description

We're looking to hire an Android developer (Remote) to join our team working on PSPDFKit Android. PSPDFKit is the leading PDF framework on iOS, it's used by Dropbox, IBM and Evernote, and we want PSPDFKit Android to match and surpass that level.

* * *

#### You will…

*   Make architectural decisions that will impact thousands of apps for years.
*   Write code that's readable, [cross-platform](/blog/2016/a-pragmatic-approach-to-cross-platform/), well documented and has meaningful [tests](/blog/2016/continuous-ios-code-coverage-with-jenkins-and-slather/) so shipping new releases can happen often and without fear.
*   Help and improve our [PDF Viewer app](/viewer) written in Kotlin.
*   Build new features and fix existing issues.
*   [Spend time to get things “right”, not to hack something up quick.](/blog/2016/writing-good-bug-reports/)
*   Collaborate daily with the whole team (Android, iOS, Support, Backend, Design) using Slack, GitHub and Google Hangouts.

* * *

#### Our ideal candidate

*   Is located somewhere within 6 hours +/- of the UTC timezone.
*   Has experience both with the Android SDK and NDK, using C++, Java (RxJava is a plus!) and [Kotlin](/blog/2016/kotlin-ready-online-guides/).
*   Has developed Android apps with a great user experience throughout.
*   Has a pragmatic approach to problem-solving.
*   Has a good command of English for writing documentation and occasional blog posts.
*   Has worked remotely and understands the different challenges of a distributed team.
*   We offer room to learn and grow - you don't need to know everything we ask for just yet, as long as you're willing to learn.

* * *

#### What you get

*   Room for personal and professional development.
*   A motivated team and a thriving work culture.
*   Numerous planned company events throughout the year.
*   The freedom to set up your ideal work environment.
*   Flexible working hours and vacation policy.

* * *

#### You should include these in your application

*   A writeup explaining who you are as a programmer. Sample questions you might want to address: How'd you get started? What projects have you enjoyed working on? Which have you disliked? What motivates you? What surprising things have you learned about yourself since starting to program?
*   A piece of code that does something you find interesting, and an explanation of why. (It doesn't have to be your own code.)
*   Links to online profiles you use (Github, Twitter, etc).
*   A description of your work history (whether as a resume, LinkedIn profile, or prose).
