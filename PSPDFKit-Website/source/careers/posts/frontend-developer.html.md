### Job Description

We’re looking to hire a frontend developer to join our team working on [PSPDFKit for Web][]. We are building a modern PDF SDK with technologies like React, Flow, Jest, and WebAssembly. Our customers host the PSPDFKit for Web Docker container themselves or rely on our [WebAssembly renderer][]. Junior developers are welcome to apply.

---

#### You Will:

- Work as part of a small, driven team that builds new features and fixes existing issues on a steady schedule.
- Make architectural decisions that will impact thousands of products for years.
- Write readable and well-documented code with meaningful [tests][] so that we can ship new releases often and without fear.
- Take the time to do things [correctly][] instead of coming up with quick fixes.
- Collaborate with the entire company (Android, iOS, Windows, Core, Support, Design, Marketing, and Sales) using [Slack][], GitHub, and Zoom.
- Support our customers in integrating our products, help them debug and fix issues, and collaborate with them to understand their requirements for our products.

---

#### You Should:

- Be located somewhere that's 6 hours +/- of the UTC timezone.
- Be familiar with or have an interest in learning JavaScript and its ecosystem of tools and packages (some of the tools we use are Flow, React, Jest, Webpack, and WebAssembly).
- Have a high-level understanding of the web technology stack (e.g. HTTP, WebSockets, cookies, DOM, CSS, and the browser as a platform).
- Be eager to learn new technologies (e.g. IndexedDB 2, Service Workers, WebAssembly), while keeping an eye open for fallbacks for older browsers (we support IE 11+).
- Have a strong interest in building user interfaces that are easy to use, responsive, and accessible to a broad variety of people.
- Have good communication skills and enjoy working on a passionate team.
- Have a pragmatic approach to problem-solving.
- Have a good command of English for writing documentation and occasional blog posts.
- Understand the challenges of working on a distributed team.

_Please note that you can be a perfect fit even if not everything we’ve outlined above applies to you. If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to ask._

#### We Offer:

- The ability to work [remotely][] and set your own schedule.
- A family-friendly work environment.
- Room for personal and professional development by encouraging learning [and][calculator] [experimenting][reviewbot].
- Two planned company events during the year (for example, in Croatia, Italy, [Spain][], Greece, and [Vienna][]).
- A motivated team that enables you to do your best work.
- A generous vacation policy of five weeks, plus an additional allowance for conferences.

---

#### An Application Should Include:

- A writeup explaining who you are as a programmer. We are especially interested in knowing how you started, what projects you have loved (or not loved) working on, what motivates you, and what surprising things you’ve learned since you began programming.
- A piece of code (it doesn’t have to be your own) that does something you find interesting, and an explanation why.
- Links to online profiles you use (e.g. GitHub, Twitter).
- A description of your work history (such as a resume, LinkedIn profile, or prose).

#### Your Day at PSPDFKit

Your day at PSPDFKit starts with an asynchronous today message in our team’s Slack channel, where you outline your goals for the day so that everyone on the team knows what everyone else is working on. All our regular company meetings occur on the same day each week, so most of the time you’ll be able to focus on your assigned tasks without interruptions.

You’ll work on adding features to our [React-based framework][] and improving the stability of our existing applications together with our customers. We strongly believe in code quality over quantity, which is why new changes undergo a proposal phase where everyone on the team is invited to collaborate. We write unit, integration, and end-to-end tests and do peer reviews for every change.

Beyond working on features and bug fixes, we also take time to help you improve upon your personal goals (through regular 1on1s and mentoring). Our remote-first focus allows you to set up working hours that best fit your daily routine. You can read more about our [onboarding period here][].
