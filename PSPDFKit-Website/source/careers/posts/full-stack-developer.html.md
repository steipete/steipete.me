### Job Description

We’re looking for a full stack developer to join our team working on [PSPDFKit for Web][]. We are building a modern PDF SDK with technologies like Elixir, React, PostgreSQL, Docker, and WebAssembly. Your role will be to implement new features in both our Elixir-powered backend and our React frontend and to improve the reliability of our product.

---

#### You Will:

- Work as part of a small, driven team that builds new features and fixes existing issues on a steady schedule.
- Make architectural decisions that will impact thousands of products for years.
- Write readable and well-documented code with meaningful [tests][] so that we can ship new releases often and without fear.
- Take the time to do things [correctly][] instead of coming up with quick fixes.
- Collaborate with the entire company (Android, iOS, Windows, Core, Support, Design, Marketing, and Sales) using [Slack][], GitHub, and Zoom.

---

#### You Should:

- Be located somewhere that's 6 hours +/- of the UTC timezone.
- Be familiar with or have an interest in learning Elixir and JavaScript (we’re using Flow type annotations) as well as their ecosystems of tools and packages.
- Have a high-level understanding of the web technology stack (e.g. HTTP, WebSockets, cookies).
- Be eager to learn new technologies (e.g. Service Workers, WebAssembly, Phoenix).
- Have a strong interest in building full stack web applications, including a scalable and consistent backend and a fast, responsive, and accessible user interface.
- Have good communication skills and enjoy working on a passionate team.
- Be eager to learn more about systems design, highly concurrent applications, immutable data, and functional programming models.
- Have a pragmatic approach to problem solving.
- Have a good command of English for writing documentation and occasional blog posts.
- Understand the challenges of working on a distributed team.

_Please note that you can be a perfect fit even if not everything we’ve outlined above applies to you. If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to ask._

---

#### We Offer:

- The ability to work [remotely][] and set your own schedule.
- A family-friendly work environment.
- Room for personal and professional development by encouraging learning [and][calculator] [experimenting][reviewbot].
- Two planned company events during the year (for example, in Croatia, Italy, [Spain][], Greece, and [Vienna][]).
- A motivated team that enables you to do your best work.
- A generous vacation policy of five weeks, plus an additional allowance for conferences.

---

#### An Application Should Include:

- A writeup explaining who you are as a programmer. We are especially interested in knowing how you started, what projects you have loved (or not loved) working on, what motivates you, and what surprising things you’ve learned since you began programming.
- A piece of code (it doesn’t have to be your own) that does something you find interesting, and an explanation as to why.
- Links to online profiles you use (e.g. GitHub, Twitter).
- A description of your work history (such as a resume, LinkedIn profile, or prose).

#### Your Day at PSPDFKit

Your day at PSPDFKit starts with an asynchronous today message in our team’s Slack channel, where you outline your goals for the day so that everyone on the team knows what everyone else is working on. All our regular company meetings occur on the same day each week, so most of the time you’ll be able to focus on your assigned tasks without interruptions. You’ll work on both adding features to our Elixir and React applications and improving the stability of our existing applications together with our customers. We strongly believe in code quality over quantity, which is why new changes undergo a proposal phase where everyone on the team is invited to collaborate. We write unit, integration, and end-to-end tests and do peer reviews for every change.

Beyond working on features and bug fixes, we also take time to help you improve upon your personal goals (through regular 1on1s and mentoring). Our remote-first focus allows you to set up working hours that best fit your daily routine. You can read more about our [onboarding period here][].
