### Job Description

We're looking to hire an Android developer to help us bring [PSPDFKit Instant](/instant) to Android.

* * *

#### You will…

*   Make architectural decisions that will impact thousands of apps for years.
*   Write code that's readable, well documented and has meaningful [tests](/blog/2016/e2e-testing/) so shipping new releases can happen often and without fear.
*   Think hard about architecture, networking and work with our existing sync server and the PDPDFKit Instant iOS SDK.
*   Build new features and fix existing issues.
*   [Spend time to get things “right”, not to hack something up quick.](/blog/2016/writing-good-bug-reports/)
*   Collaborate daily with the whole team (Android, iOS, Support, Backend, Design) using Slack, GitHub and Google Hangouts.

* * *

#### Our ideal candidate

*   Is located somewhere within 6 hours +/- of the UTC timezone.
*   Has experience both with the Android SDK with Java (RxJava is a plus!) and [Kotlin](/blog/2016/kotlin-ready-online-guides/).
*   Has developed Android apps with a great user experience throughout.
*   Has a pragmatic approach to problem-solving.
*   Has a good command of English for writing documentation and occasional blog posts.
*   Has worked remotely and understands the different challenges of a distributed team.

* * *

#### What you get

*   Room for personal and professional development.
*   A motivated team and a thriving work culture.
*   Numerous planned company events throughout the year.
*   The freedom to set up your ideal work environment.
*   Flexible working hours and vacation policy.

* * *

#### You should include these in your application

*   A writeup explaining who you are as a programmer. Sample questions you might want to address: How'd you get started? What projects have you enjoyed working on? Which have you disliked? What motivates you? What surprising things have you learned about yourself since starting to program?
*   A piece of code that does something you find interesting, and an explanation of why. (It doesn't have to be your own code.)
*   Links to online profiles you use (Github, Twitter, etc).
*   A description of your work history (whether as a resume, LinkedIn profile, or prose).
