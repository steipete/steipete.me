### Job Description

We’re looking to hire a junior developer to join our Windows team in Vienna working on PSPDFKit, the leading cross-platform PDF framework. Our framework is used by thousands of companies and more than a billion users in countless different settings. The focus of the role is on Windows but you will be learning and working on Web technologies, Linux and even macOS and Android. The development of our Windows platform is multi-lingual and cutting edge. We are at the forefront of Windows development and this is a great opportunity to learn and develop valuable skills and enjoy yourself whilst doing so. Every single day with us is full of new and exciting challenges like designing easy-to-understand API and writing robust code and ultimately creating a great developer and user experience. In this role, you will learn a lot and grow into an experienced engineer while working on a huge, interesting project. 

**Please note** that we do not offer relocation — you should already be in Vienna or have relevant remote working experience!
