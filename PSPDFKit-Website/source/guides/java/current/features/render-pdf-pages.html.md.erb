Rendering a PDF to an image is made simple with the PSPDFKit Java Library. We leverage the JDK in order to maintain compatibility and stay efficient.

## Render a Page

Once you have a document instance, it’s very simple to render a page. The following will open a document and render page 0 with the dimensions of the page:

```java
File file = new File("Assets/default.pdf");
PdfDocument document = new PdfDocument(new FileDataProvider(file));
PdfPage page = document.getPage(0);
BufferedImage image = page.renderPage();
```

It’s also possible to pass custom dimensions to scale the image:

```java
BufferedImage image = document.getPage(0).renderPage(50, 50);
```

## Save to File

`renderPage` returns a native Java [`BufferedImage`][] object. Saving it out as a PNG image, for example, would look like this:

```java
File file = new File("out/test.png");
boolean wrote = ImageIO.write(image, "png", file);
```
