The PSPDFKit Java Library is built to support Java SE 8. To develop with the library, you will need to have a compatible development kit installed, which means you will require JDK8+.

The JDK can be obtained via multiple sources. The main source is [Oracle][oracle-jdk], but other sources are available â€” for example, [AdoptOpenJDK][adopt-open-jdk] supplies precompiled binaries for many well-known operating systems.

In order to take advantage of the already proven C++ PSPDFKit Core, the library has a native element to it. Because there is a native element, there are strict operating system support requirements.

## Windows

The native library has been compiled under Windows 10 and will support all Microsoft-supported versions of Windows 10 (version 1703+). Currently, the architectures supported are `i386` and `x64`. For more information on Windows release support, please consult the [Windows lifecycle fact sheet][windows-lifecycle-fact-sheet].

## Linux

We have compiled the native library to support most major Linux distributions. There is a requirement of at least Glibc 2.19, which ensures compatibility with most major long-term support and other newer distributions. Currently, the architecture supported is `x64`.

## macOS

The macOS native binary has been compiled with and will only support Mojave 10.14+.
