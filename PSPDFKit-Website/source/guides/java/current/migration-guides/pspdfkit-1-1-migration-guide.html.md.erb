This article provides a set of guidelines for migrating from version 1.0 to version 1.1 of the PSPDFKit Java Library.

## Opening a Document

In order to simplify the public model and design for the future, we have changed the way to open a document. Now [`PdfDocument`][] has a `public static` method named [`open`][], which should be called in favor of constructing a new [`PdfDocument`], which was done previously. The change is simple to make, as can be seen below.

This:

```java
PdfDocument document = new PdfDocument(new FileDataProvider(file));
```

becomes this:

```java
PdfDocument document = PdfDocument.open(new FileDataProvider(file));
```

[`pdfdocument`]: /api/java/reference/com/pspdfkit/api/PdfDocument.html
[`open`]: /api/java/reference/com/pspdfkit/api/PdfDocument.html#open(com.pspdfkit.api.providers.DataProvider)
