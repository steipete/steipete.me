Developers can use [Xamarin][] to write native iOS, Android, and macOS apps with a shared C# codebase. We provide separate bindings for iOS and Android, as they are different SDKs that each have an API that closely matches their respective underlying system.

We offer [bindings for PSPDFKit for Android][xamarin-android] and regularly update them to be compatible with new releases. A recent version of Visual Studio for Mac or Windows is required. See the project [README][] for details.

## Building PSPDFKit.Android.dll

### Requirements

PSPDFKit runs on Android devices running:

- Xamarin.Android >= 9.4.1.0
- Microsoft Mobile OpenJDK 1.8.0
- Android 4.4 or newer / API level 19 or higher
- 32/64-bit ARM (armeabi-v7a with NEON/ arm64-v8a) or 32/64-bit Intel x86 CPU

It’s also important that:

- Projects using `PSPDFKit.Android.dll` set the [target framework][] to API 28 (Android 9.0).
- In Android Options, select `d8` as your `Dex compiler`. Otherwise, you will get errors about default interface methods not being supported.

### Step 1 — Get the Bindings

1. Clone the [`PSPDFKit/Xamarin-Android`][xamarin-android] repository from GitHub.
2. Switch to the `Xamarin-Android` directory.

### Step 2 — Get PSPDFKit AAR files

1. Download PSPDFKit from the [Customer Portal][] if you haven’t done so already, or [request an evaluation version][trial].
2. Unzip the PSPDFKit file you downloaded above and copy `pspdfkit-x.x.x.aar` to the `PSPDFKit.Android/Jars` folder.
3. Run the `./build.sh` command (on macOS) or the `./build.ps1` command (on Windows, PowerShell) from the root directory. This will download additional resources needed by the binding. Note that running this will require you to have [Xamarin][] already installed on your computer.

**ℹ️ Note:** Ensure the files are named `pspdfkit-x.x.x.aar` and `pspdfkit-instant-x.x.x.aar` so that there is no hidden `.zip` file ending. macOS likes to add these things and doesn’t show them by default. Use the Inspector to be sure.

Visual Studio will use the default Java, but this can be customized in Preferences > SDK Locations > Java SDK (JDK).

### Step 3 — Get your DLLs

You have two options to do this.

#### Build from PSPDFKit.Android.sln

1. Open `PSPDFKit.Android.sln` in `Visual Studio`.
2. Build the project.
3. Get the DLLs from the `PSPDFKit.Android/bin` folder.
4. Enjoy.

#### Build from Terminal

1. Just grab `PSPDFKit.Android.dll` from the root folder. If you successfully followed Step 1 from above, both should be there.
2. Enjoy.

**ℹ️ Note:** `PSPDFKit.Android.Instant.dll` is an optional dependency, and you only need it if you are using [PSPDFKit Instant][] collaboration features in your application.

## Xamarin.Forms

Xamarin.Forms does not support embedding `Fragments`. However, you can show a new `Activity`, so fullscreen PDF display is possible. See [the provided Xamarin.Forms example][] for more details.

Xamarin.Forms does not allow hijacking the `ContentPage`, so by default, only fullscreen presentation is allowed. With the new [Xamarin.Forms embedding][], you can take any `ContentPage` and add it to your native applications. This technique is also showcased by our [PSPDFCatalog example app][].

### Open a PDF

Opening a PDF with PSPDFKit for Xamarin is as simple as this:

```csharp
var pspdfkitConfiguration = new PdfActivityConfiguration.Builder (ApplicationContext)
	.PageMode (PSPDFPageMode.Single)
	.PageTransition (PSPDFPageTransition.ScrollContinuous)
	.ScrollDirection (PSPDFScrollDirection.Vertical)

PdfActivity.ShowDocument (this, docUri, pspdfkitConfiguration);
```
