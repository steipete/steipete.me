You can include PSPDFKit in applications that will be distributed to devices not supported by PSPDFKit. In such a case, `PSPDFKit.initialize()` will throw [`PSPDFKitInitializationFailedException`][], which you must catch and handle appropriately:

[==

```kotlin
try {
    PSPDFKit.initialize(context, LICENSE)
} catch (e : PSPDFKitInitializationFailedException) {
    Log.e(LOG_TAG, "Current device is not compatible with PSPDFKit!")
}
```

```java
try {
    PSPDFKit.initialize(context, LICENSE);
} catch (PSPDFKitInitializationFailedException e) {
    Log.e(LOG_TAG, "Current device is not compatible with PSPDFKit!");
}
```
