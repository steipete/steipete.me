title: What Is a Bundle ID?
section: developers
---

Every Android app requires an applicationId (package name) to work. This is a string that is set up during development, usually in the form of `com.example.yourapp` in your Gradle `build.config`. Please note that the terms applicationId and bundle ID are generally used interchangeably:

```build.gradle
android {
    defaultConfig {
        applicationId "com.example.yourapp"
        ...
    }
    ...
}
```

PSPDFKit bases your license on the bundle ID you provide. This has to be an explicit ID, meaning an ID that is unique and does not contain a star (\*) value.

Once a bundle ID is registered in the PSPDFKit license portal, it can’t be changed. Please note that these IDs are case-sensitive, so make sure you register the correct case variant.

## Development and Testing

For development and testing, you can request additional bundle IDs [from our license portal][pspdfkit backend]. Please ensure that you have registered the actual bundle ID beforehand, and that the beta/testing ID is recognizable as such.

Example:
If your product is named FaxSender and your company name is OKBX Corporation, then your bundle ID will likely look like this: `com.okbx.faxsender`. Your testing IDs could be `com.okbx.faxsender.dev`, `com.okbx.faxsender.staging`, `com.okbx.faxsender.testing`, or `com.okbx.faxsender.beta`.

```build.gradle
android {
  ...
  buildTypes {
      debug {
          applicationIdSuffix ".dev"
      }
  }
}
```

We approve these IDs manually and will add them if they match the above scheme. If you have a different scheme, please let us know and we will consider your case.

If you can’t find the Request Beta ID link, you either have no license entry (which could mean your payment is open), or you haven’t yet registered your actual bundle ID with your license. Please complete your payment or register your bundle ID, and the Beta ID request feature will work.
