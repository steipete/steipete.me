title: PSPDFKit SDK Security
section: developers
---

PSPDFKit has been implemented using the latest and best security practices and is used in security-conscious applications.

- Encrypted PDFs are supported and cannot be accessed without the matching password.
- PDF passwords are never persisted.
- A `PdfDocument` can be encrypted with AES256-CTR and can be decrypted on the fly (keeping it only decrypted in memory). See `AesDataProvider` in the Catalog app for more information.
- Code commits are always peer reviewed and have to pass our large test case set before being merged.
- We use a large set of compiler warnings and the latest version of Clang Analyzer, the Android `lint` tool, Error Prone, and PMD to detect and fix potential problems before the product is released.

## Cache

Rendered pages will be cached to disk by default to ensure fast display and browsing. This cache can be customized on both the [activity and fragment level][pspdfkit api diskcachesize] and can also be turned off completely.

## Security-Related Considerations

- PSPDFKit might keep parts of extracted text, annotations, or passwords in memory to perform the requested operations. If rogue code has access to your applicationâ€™s memory, there is nothing you can do and the device has already been compromised. This could happen if a device is rooted.
- By default, PSPDFKit does not prevent taking screenshots. To prevent screenshot taking (as well as showing the window on non-secure screens), you can set the [`FLAG_SECURE`][] window flag in your custom activity.
- The default value of [`PdfConfiguration.Builder#videoPlaybackEnabled`][] depends on the [exploitability of a device][stagefright]. To prevent Stagefright exploits from malicious videos this means:
  - On devices with API 23+ and a security patch dating 01 February 2016 or newer, video playback is enabled by default. These devices are no longer vulnerable to Stagefright exploits.
  - On devices with API <23 or on devices with API 23+ but with a security patch from before 01 February 2016, video playback is disabled by default. You can, however, manually enable video playback for your app via [`PdfConfiguration.Builder#videoPlaybackEnabled`][].

## Network Access

PSPDFKit only performs network access when required for the following actions:

- Accessing images/videos/audio from the gallery (using the YouTube or Picasso libraries).
- Simple analytics for demo, nightly, and beta builds/licenses.
- Via the inline `WebView`, if a URL prefixed with `pspdfkit://` is tapped.
