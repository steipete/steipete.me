One of the most common sources of layout problems with PSPDFKit is the use of the `android:configChanges` option on the activity declaration inside your appâ€™s `AndroidManifest.xml`.

Here are some of the layout problems you might experience:

- Displaced pages in the document
- Wrong action bar size, or visual glitches in the action bar
- Other layout problems occurring after changing the device orientation

If you experience these layout problems, try removing an `android:ConfigChanges` option from your `<activity />` declaration.
