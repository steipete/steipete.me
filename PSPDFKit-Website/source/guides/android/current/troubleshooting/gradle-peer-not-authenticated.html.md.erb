title: Gradle "peer not authenticated" Error
section: developers
---

If you see the following error while trying to [automatically integrate PSPDFKit using Gradle][pspdfkit guide integrating pspdfkit], it is probably caused by using an outdated JDK (Java Development Kit) inside Android Studio:

```
FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.

* What went wrong:
A problem occurred configuring project ':app'.
> Could not download pspdfkit.aar (com.pspdfkit:pspdfkit:x.y.z)
 > Could not get resource 'https://customers.pspdfkit.com/maven/com/pspdfkit/pspdfkit/x.y.z/pspdfkit-x.y.z.aar'.
  > Could not GET 'https://customers.pspdfkit.com/maven/com/pspdfkit/pspdfkit/x.y.z/pspdfkit-x.y.z.aar'.
   > peer not authenticated
```

The PSPDFKit Maven repository requires Gradle to communicate securely using TSL 1.2, which is disabled in JDK versions prior to JDK 8. [See this issue on the JDK bug tracker][jdk bug tracker issue].

## How to Fix the “peer not authenticated” Error

- Download and install JDK 8 for your local development machine. You can find the current version at the [Oracle JDK download page][].
- Inside Android Studio, open your affected project.
  - Go to File > Project Structure.
  - Click the SDK Location tab.
  - Select your locally installed JDK 8 directory as the JDK location.
    - On macOS: Run `/usr/libexec/java_home --version 1.8` within the terminal, which will output the correct JDK folder.
    - On Windows: Run `for %i in (javac.exe) do @echo. %~$PATH:i` in the command line, and select the correct JDK 8 folder.
  - Confirm your changes by pressing OK.
- Rebuild your project and verify that the error is resolved.
