title: Intercepting touch events passed to PSPDFKit
section: knowledge-base
---

PSPDFKit consumes touch events on displayed documents while providing simple callbacks for the most interesting events. See [Document Listeners guide][] for a full list of exposed events.

If you need to observe all touch events, for example to detect multitouch, we recommend you to wrap the [`PdfFragment`][] inside a custom [`ViewGroup`][]. You can then observe all touch events and intercept them before being handled in `PdfFragment` by implementing [`ViewGroup#onInterceptTouchEvent()`][]. You can read more about this mechanism in [Manage touch events in a ViewGroup guide][manage touch events guide].
