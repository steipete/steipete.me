If you want to show search view and/or start search in the search view you can use the following method in [`PdfActivity`][].

You'll need to register PSPDFKit views visibility change listener in order to start search immediately after search view is shown:

```CustomActivity.kt
pspdfKitViews.addOnVisibilityChangedListener(object : OnVisibilityChangedListener {
    override fun onShow(view: View) {
        if (view is PdfSearchViewInline) {
            view.setInputFieldText("query", true)
        } else if (view is PdfSearchViewModular) {
            view.setInputFieldText("query", true)
        }
        pspdfKitViews.removeOnVisibilityChangedListener(this)
    }

    override fun onHide(view: View) {
    }
})
```

You can then show the search view via:

```CustomActivity.kt
pspdfKitViews.showView(PSPDFKitViews.Type.VIEW_SEARCH)
```

If you want to invoke search programatically or if you want to build custom search UI take a look at our [text search guide][] that explains all aspects of search and its integration in your UI.
