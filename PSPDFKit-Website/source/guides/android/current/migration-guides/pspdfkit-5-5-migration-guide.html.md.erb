This article provides a set of guidelines for migrating from PSPDFKit 5.4 for Android to PSPDFKit 5.5 for Android.

## Updated Dependencies

With PSPDFKit 5.5, we updated various dependencies of PSPDFKit:

- **Build System Dependencies**
  - The version of NDK used to build PSPDFKit’s native sources was updated to version 20.0.5594570.

## Unification of Full and Demo Libraries

Starting with PSPDFKit 5.5, we no longer provide a separate demo version of PSPDFKit for Android. Evaluation of our framework can now be done using the exact same binary that is used by customers of our full version.

If you are currently evaluating PSPDFKit for Android and want to update your trial to 5.5, you need to adjust the name of the dependency inside your project’s `dependencies` block, like so:

```build.gradle
dependencies {
    // Use this for integrating the demo version of PSPDFKit for Android
    implementation 'com.pspdfkit:pspdfkit:5.5.0'
    implementation 'com.pspdfkit:pspdfkit-instant:5.5.0'
}
```

> **ℹ️ Note:** Customers who already use the full version of PSPDFKit for Android do not need to change the name of the dependency, but instead should simply update the version to `5.5.0`.

## Notable Changes and Deprecations

- Deprecates `AnnotationProvider#getAllAnnotationsOfType()`. Use `AnnotationProvider#getAllAnnotationsOfTypeAsync()` instead. `AnnotationProvider#getAllAnnotationsOfType()` will be made into a blocking call in PSPDFKit for Android 6.
