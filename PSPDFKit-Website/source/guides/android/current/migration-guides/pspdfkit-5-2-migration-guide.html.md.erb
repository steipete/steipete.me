This article provides a set of guidelines for migrating from PSPDFKit 5.1 for Android to PSPDFKit 5.2 for Android. If youâ€™re upgrading from a version earlier than 5.1, please review the [Android 5.1 Migration Guide][] first.

## Updated Dependencies

With PSPDFKit 5.2, we updated various dependencies of PSPDFKit:

- **Maven Dependencies**
  - Kotlin to 1.3.20.
- **Build System Dependencies**
  - We updated all example projects and the internal PSPDFKit build system to Android Gradle plugin 3.3.0. The minimum supported Android Studio version is now also the latest stable version, 3.3.
- **Additional Dependencies**
  - The Android NDK used to build PSPDFKit was updated to 19.0.5232133.
  - The bundled SQLite binaries were updated to 3.26.0.
  - The Botan library was updated to version 2.9.0.

## Notable Changes and Deprecations

- Deprecates `PSPDFKit#setLoggingEnabled()`. Use `PdfLog#removeAllLoggers()` or a custom `Logger` that ignores all messages.
- Removes the `PdfActivityMenuManager` class as well as `PdfActivity#getActivityMenuManager()`, as these did not add useful features to the public API.
- Deprecates `Signer#signFormField(SignatureFormField, BiometricSignatureData, OutputStream, OnSigningCompleteCallback)`. Use `Signer#signFormField(SignerOptions, OnSigningCompleteCallback)` instead.
- Deprecates `Signer#signFormFieldAsync(SignatureFormField, BiometricSignatureData, OutputStream)`. Use `Signer#signFormFieldAsync(SignerOptions)` instead.
- `PdfActivity#onPrepareOptionsMenu()` no longer clears menu items added in `PdfActivity#onCreateOptionsMenu()`. You should use the `onCreateOptionsMenu()` to create your custom menu items and use the `onPrepareOptionsMenu()` only to modify the state of menu items when the menu gets shown.
