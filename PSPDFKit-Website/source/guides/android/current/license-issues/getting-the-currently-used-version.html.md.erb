title: Getting the Currently Used Version
section: developers
---

If you are unsure about the version of PSPDFKit you are using, there are ways to find out. In code, the `PSPDFKit` class will show the current version number via its static `VERSION` field. If your app depends on it, you can access it at runtime:

[==

```kotlin
val versionString = PSPDFKit.VERSION
```

```java
final String versionString = PSPDFKit.VERSION;
```

==]

You can also inspect the contents of the `VERSION` field inside Android Studio to get the version number at development time.
