title: Low-Resolution Render API
section: developers
---

In order to achieve quick and fluid page browsing in a document, `PdfFragment` will first render and draw low-resolution images for each page that is about to be displayed before switching to a high-resolution rendering for visible pages. The render settings (i.e. the resolution of low-resolution images) are chosen using a smart low-resolution strategy based on [Device Year Class][], balancing page render times, quality, and memory performance.

The default behavior relies on optimized resolutions to allow a better match with a device’s specifications, but if your use case requires a specific low resolution, you can override our automatic low-resolution strategy.

## Optimized Resolution

With PSPDFKit 4.3 for Android, we introduced the optimized resolution strategy by default. For further information, please see our [Device Year Class guide][].

## Fixed Resolution

To exclude our optimized resolution algorithm,
[`PdfConfiguration.Builder#setFixedLowResRenderPixelCount()`][] and [`PdfConfiguration#getFixedLowResRenderPixelCount()`][] can be used to set and retrieve a fixed low-resolution render pixel count:

[==

```kotlin
val configuration = PdfConfiguration.Builder()
    .setFixedLowResRenderPixelCount(1280 * 1280)
    .build()
```

```java
final PdfConfiguration configuration = new PdfConfiguration.Builder()
    .setFixedLowResRenderPixelCount(1280 * 1280)
    .build();
```

==]

In this way, the same value (`1280 * 1280`) will be used for all devices.

**⚠️ Important:** Misuse of the low-resolution render pixel count may lead to poor performance and/or out-of-memory exceptions on older devices. Make sure to test the new value on a wide range of devices.
