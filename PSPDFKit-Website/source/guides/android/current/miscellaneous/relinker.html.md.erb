PSPDFKit has integrated support for [ReLinker][], which is a robust native library loader for Android. When using Android apps with native libraries (like PSPDFKit does), you occasionally will see errors like the following, which are caused by Android’s unreliable `PackageManager` implementation:

```
Caused by: java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: Library libpspdfkit not found
at java.lang.Runtime.loadLibrary(Runtime.java:461)
at java.lang.System.loadLibrary(System.java:557)
at com.example.NativeStuff.<clinit>(Native.java:16)
... 5 more
```

ReLinker fixes these issues by replacing the standard `System.loadLibrary` call with a more reliable implementation. With Gradle, PSPDFKit [automatically adds][] ReLinker as a transitive dependency — no further action is required to make ReLinker work. However, if you are using [manual library integration][], you need to add ReLinker to the `dependencies` block of your `build.gradle` file.

## Add ReLinker

> **Important:** This integration is only required if you manually integrate the PSPDFKit `.aar` file. If you used Maven/Gradle for integrating PSPDFKit, ReLinker has already been set up for you.

1. Go to https://github.com/KeepSafe/ReLinker and look for the current version of ReLinker.
2. Inside the `dependencies` block of your `app/build.gradle`, add the following (replace the version with the current one):

   ```build.gradle
   dependencies {
       implementation 'com.getkeepsafe.relinker:relinker:<%= guide_constant('android', 'relinker_version') %>'
   }
   ```

3. Run your app. PSPDFKit will automatically pick up ReLinker and use it.

## Remove ReLinker

If you do not want to use ReLinker in your app, you can disable it by excluding the transitive Gradle dependency inside your `build.gradle`. PSPDFKit will detect that ReLinker is no longer present and it will fall back to the default `System.loadLibrary` call:

```build.gradle
dependencies {
    implementation('com.pspdfkit:pspdfkit:<%= latest_version(:android) %>') {
        exclude group: 'com.getkeepsafe.relinker', module: 'relinker'
    }
}
```

> **ℹ️ Note:** Deactivate ReLinker at your own risk, as this may cause unwanted app crashes on some devices.
