title: Device Year Class
section: developers
---

Starting with PSPDFKit 4.3 for Android, we started using [Device Year Class][], which is a library from Facebook that analyzes an Android device’s specifications. When rendering low-resolution images, we felt the need to implement a simple algorithm that maps a device’s RAM, CPU cores, and clock speed in order to calculate the best resolution possible without performance degradation.

The goal of Device Year Class is to classify a device in one of the following categories:

- `LOW_RES_RENDER_HIGH` — For high-end devices from 2014 and later. This category will use a maximum pixel count of `2048 * 2048`, even for those device screens with a higher resolution.
- `LOW_RES_RENDER_MEDIUM` — For middle-end devices from 2013. This category will use a maximum pixel count of `1536 * 1536` and will fall back to the actual screen resolution when lower.
- `LOW_RES_RENDER_LOW` — For low-end devices from 2012. This category will use a maximum pixel count of `1024 * 1024` and will fall back to the actual screen resolution when lower.
- `LOW_RES_RENDER_VERY_LOW` — For very old devices. This category is reserved for devices with poor specs and limited memory, and it will use a safe maximum pixel count of `512 * 512`.

## Add Device Year Class (Only for Manual Integration)

> **Important:** This integration is only required if you manually integrated the PSPDFKit `.aar` file. If you used Maven/Gradle for integrating PSPDFKit, Device Year Class has already been set up for you.

1. Go to https://github.com/facebook/device-year-class and look for the current version of Device Year Class.
2. Inside the `dependencies` block of your `app/build.gradle`, add the following (replace the version with the current one):

   ```build.gradle
   dependencies {
       implementation 'com.facebook.device.yearclass:yearclass:<%= guide_constant('android', 'yearclass_version') %>'
   }
   ```

3. Run your app. PSPDFKit will automatically pick up Device Year Class and use it.

## Remove Device Year Class

If you do not want to use Device Year Class in your app, you can disable it by excluding the transitive Gradle dependency inside your `build.gradle`. PSPDFKit will detect that Device Year Class is no longer present and will fall back to the maximum pixel count of `1024 * 1024`, which is suited for the majority of use cases and compatible with a wide range of devices:

```build.gradle
dependencies {
    implementation('com.pspdfkit:pspdfkit:<%= latest_version(:android) %>') {
        exclude group: 'com.facebook.device.yearclass', module: 'yearclass'
    }
}
```

To set a fixed low-resolution render pixel count, please see the [Low-Resolution Render API][] guide.

> **ℹ️ Note:** Deactivating Device Year Class will lead to unoptimized values for the latest devices.
