PSPDFKit ships with a few projects containing a lot of examples to help you with your code. You can find these projects in the `example` folder of the `.zip` file you downloaded from your [customer portal][] or in the demo download.

What follows is a rundown of the example projects and what they contain.

## Catalog App

This app contains a lot of examples on how to use PSPDFKit in your project. It also shows some high-level use cases, like the `ScreenReaderExample`. To build the Catalog app, open the `example/catalog/` folder within Android Studio and press Run.

The Catalog app contains examples for:

- Loading documents from various sources (app assets, resources, content providers, memory...)
- Using the [`PdfFragment`][] in custom barebone activities
- UI customizations (activities, toolbars, layouts...)
- Activity styling/theming
- Accessing annotations from code
- Multimedia embedding
- Annotation processing with the [`PdfProcessor`][]
- Full-text search
- ...and lots of other use cases.

> **ðŸ’¡ Tip:** You can use the External Document example to open any document from your device or from available document providers (e.g. Dropbox or Google Drive).

## Simple App

This example app (inside `example/simple/`) shows the minimum code required to start building an app with PSPDFKit. You can simply copy this project to your working space and use it as a template for your app.
