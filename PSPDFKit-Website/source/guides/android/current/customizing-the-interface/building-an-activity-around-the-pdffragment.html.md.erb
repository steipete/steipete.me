title: Building an Activity around the PdfFragment
section: developers
---

You might want to customize the user interface of your app beyond what is possible with the predefined UI of the [`PdfActivity`][]. The greatest flexibility can be achieved by embedding the [`PdfFragment`][] into a custom [`AppCompatActivity`][]. This guide provides the foundation for using the fragment in a custom environment in conjunction with existing PSPDFKit widgets that are also used by the [`PdfActivity`][].

> **ℹ️ Note:** This article describes how to manually build a custom activity that uses the [`PdfFragment`][] and other framework widgets. The other, simpler solutions are to either [extend the existing `PdfActivity`][pspdfkit guide extending pdfactivity] or [load a document into the default `PdfActivity`][pspdfkit guide using activity]. You can also use the [`PdfUiFragment`][] to display the document with the same UI the [`PdfActivity`][] uses. To see how, please refer to the [Using a Fragment guide][pspdfkit guide using fragment].

## Embedding the Fragment

Take a look at our [Using a Fragment][pspdfkit guide using fragment] guide, which shows the basics of setting up the [`PdfFragment`][] by providing a license and configuration. A runnable code example can be found inside our Catalog app: The `FragmentExample` showcases how to use the [`PdfFragment`][] in a custom [`AppCompatActivity`][].

## Providing Search

PSPDFKit has two predefined search widgets that are also used by the [`PdfActivity`][]:

- [`PdfSearchViewInline`][] is a small search widget that, when expanded, sits inside the main action bar. It provides an input field, a results label showing the number of found results, and controls for navigating back and forth inside the results. This widget is useful on smaller devices, where a list of all results would overlay the viewed document.

- [`PdfSearchViewModular`][] is an expandable panel that sits above the document area. It shows a full scrollable list of all results, including preview snippets. Tapping a result will close the search view and navigate to the page containing the result.

> **ℹ️ Note:** As a third option, you can manually build a custom search widget using our [extensive search API][pspdfkit guide text search].

## Providing Toolbars

You can use all the PSPDFKit toolbars as standalone views in your custom activities. Have a look at the [Using Toolbars within Fragment][] guide for more information.

## Form Editing UI

[`PdfActivity`][] includes the form editing UI out of the box. Take a look at the [Using the Form Editing UI within Fragment][] guide if you want to integrate the form editing UI into your custom activity.
