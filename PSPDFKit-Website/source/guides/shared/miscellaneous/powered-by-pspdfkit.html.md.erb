## Guidelines

- Please contact sales@pspdfkit.com before you use our logo.
- Tapping or clicking on the logo should open our website (https://pspdfkit.com).

![Logo Whitespace](/images/guides/shared/miscellaneous/powered-by-pspdfkit/logo-whitespace.png)

- The logo comes in two basic shapes: portrait and landscape.
- When placing the logo, make sure there is enough whitespace around it.
- When sizing the logo, make sure the text is large enough to be readable.

![Logo Sizing](/images/guides/shared/miscellaneous/powered-by-pspdfkit/logo-sizing.png)

- Do not place the logo too far away from other UI elements; the logo should come into view during normal scrolling operations.
- Do not place the logo between UI elements; it should be an element clearly separate from your user interface.
- Do not cover large portions of the screen area with the logo.
- Do not cut off the logo; make sure both the view transformation and the device orientation don’t affect the logo’s visibility.

![Logo Colors](/images/guides/shared/miscellaneous/powered-by-pspdfkit/logo-colors.png)

- Make sure the contrast between the logo and the container view’s background color is high.
- Do not use the full color version on dark, textured, or colored backgrounds.

![Logo Preferred](/images/guides/shared/miscellaneous/powered-by-pspdfkit/logo-preferred.png)

- Use the full color version of the logo on white or bright backgrounds.
- Use the single-color-tinted version on colored, textured, or dark backgrounds.

![Logo Customized](/images/guides/shared/miscellaneous/powered-by-pspdfkit/logo-customized.png)

- When using the single-color version of the logo, you can adjust its tint to match your application’s look and feel as long as the logo-to-background contrast stays high and the text is readable.
- If you are unsure whether the design of the view showing the logo is acceptable, feel free to get in touch with our team via sales@pspdfkit.com.
