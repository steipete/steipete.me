If your PDF document has embedded fonts, any viewer on any device should render them as expected. A PDF viewer will replace a font if the document does not have it embedded and if it is not available on the device.

Hereâ€™s how determine if your PDF document has embedded fonts:

- Open the PDF document in [Acrobat Pro][] or [Acrobat Reader][] (free and available on all platforms).

- Go to the File menu and select Properties, or use the Command + D keyboard shortcut.

- Click on the Fonts tab.

You may see the words Embedded Subset (like in the example above) or just the word Embedded. If a subset of a font is embedded, this means that only the characters used in that particular document are embedded.

Most PDF-authoring apps like [Acrobat Pro][] support embedding fonts in a PDF document. Make sure you embed the fonts so that your document looks as expected across devices and readers.
