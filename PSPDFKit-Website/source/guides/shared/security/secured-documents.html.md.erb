PDF documents can be secured with a password or with other security methods. PSPDFKit can handle protected and secured documents and write annotations and forms into a password-protected document the same as it would with a non-protected document.

As shown above, Acrobat defines various restrictions — for example, sometimes form filling is disallowed for a document.

Sometimes documents are password secured but have an empty password set. This might sound paradoxical, but this is not unusual in the PDF world. In such a case, PSPDFKit will attempt to unlock documents with an empty password before showing the password dialog. This way, users don’t get confused. This behavior is the same as in Adobe Acrobat.

You can create password-protected documents using PSPDFKit. Check out our [Document Processing guide][] for more details.
