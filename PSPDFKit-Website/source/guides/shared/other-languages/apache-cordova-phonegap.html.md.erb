[Apache Cordova][] is an open source platform for building native apps using HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript.

Cordova is a cross-platform product. PSPDFKit SDKs are highly optimized and refined for a specific platform in order to offer the best possible user experience. You can support both iOS and Android with your Cordova app, as we offer plugins for both of these major mobile platforms. The configuration and setup are similar, but not the same, as each platform works differently.

We offer a [Cordova plugin][] for both our iOS and Android SDKs. The philosophy here is that our wrapper/binding layer is open source and offers the most commonly needed customization options. If your requirements are not met, you can dig in and extend our wrapper or create a pull request.
