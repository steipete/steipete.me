[React Native][] enables you to build native mobile apps using JavaScript and React.

PSPDFKit is available as a [native module][] and as a [native UI component][] on [GitHub][]. You can find an introduction to the module on our [blog][pspdfkit blog react native] and an update for the native UI component in a [follow-up blog post (iOS)][pspdfkit blog rn ui component ios].

PSPDFKit supports React Native for iOS, Android, and Windows UWP.

For build and usage instructions, please take a look at the README in the repository. We also provide a sample app called [Catalog][].

Both the React Native module and UI component are open source, so you can customize them yourself and even send [pull requests][]. For more details, take a look at the [How to Extend React Native APIs][pspdfkit blog how to extend react native apis] and [Advanced Techniques for React Native UI Components][pspdfkit blog advanced techniques for react native ui components] blog posts.

[See here for an overview of all our React Native blog posts][react native blog posts].

## Using Expo

Expo is a free and open source toolchain built around React Native to help you build native iOS and Android projects using JavaScript and React. PSPDFKit is a native component and requires ejecting/detaching for successful integration.

Read up on [Ejecting to ExpoKit][] to learn how to eject your project. Expo provides [ExpoKit][] for these situations, and it allows you to keep much of the Expo functionality.
