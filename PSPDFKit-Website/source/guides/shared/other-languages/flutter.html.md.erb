[Flutter][] allows you to build native apps on Android and iOS from a single codebase.

PSPDFKit supports Flutter on both Android and iOS.

PSPDFKit for Flutter is available as an open source plugin on [GitHub][] so that you can customize it yourself and even send [pull requests][].

For build and usage instructions, please take a look at the [README][github] in the repository. We also provide a very easy-to-run [example project][example] and have written a handful of [blog posts about Flutter][flutter blog posts].
