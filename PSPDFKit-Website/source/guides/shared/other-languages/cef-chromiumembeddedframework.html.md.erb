The [Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF)][cef] is an open source framework used to embed the Chromium (Chrome) browser engine in other applications.

# PSPDFKit for Windows Vista/7/8/8.1 via CEF

With CEF, PSPDFKit can be integrated into almost any desktop-style application on any OS, similar to our [Electron][] support. The most common use case is integrating PSPDFKit into apps that are built with WIN32 or WPF instead of UWP.

[CefSharp][], a popular binding for CEF, supports Windows Vista, 7, 8, 8.1, and 10.

## Using CEF with CefSharp on Windows

**Support for CefSharp on Windows is currently in beta. Please contact us for a sample app.**

The 7zip file provided contains a modified version of the official CefSharp minimal example solution. It is a Git repository, and the last commit on master contains the complete changes necessary for using our SDK with CefSharp.

A scheme handler, which supplies the files requested by the CefSharp control, is registered for http. This is just a very basic custom scheme handler to demonstrate how to handle requests, and it is not production-ready code. To fully implement a custom scheme handler, please consult [the CefSharp documentation][].

#### Running the Sample

To get the sample to run, do the following:

- Unzip the minimal example project and open the solution contained within it.
- Make sure `CefSharp.MinimalExample.Wpf` is the active project.
- In the Solution Explorer, open the file `CefSharp.MinimalExample.Wpf\Properties\assets\license`.
- Replace the `LICENSE_KEY_GOES_HERE` text with your license key.
- Open `CefSharp.MinimalExample.Wpf\CefSharpSchemeHandlerFactory.cs` and change the string `cef.example.com` to match the bundle ID of your license. This is essential!
- Open `CefSharp.MinimalExample.Wpf\MainWindow.xaml` and change the string `cef.example.com` to match your bundle ID.
- Right-click on the project `CefSharp.MinimalExample.Wpf` and click on Build.
- Start the project and it should display `default.pdf` in the app.

## Troubleshooting

If the PDF is not displayed, you can troubleshoot the app while it is running by opening a Chrome browser, navigating to http://localhost:8088/, and clicking on PSPDFKit for Web.

This will open a connection to the running app and you can switch to the Console tab of the developer tools and examine any error messages.
