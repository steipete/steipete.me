title: Remove Apps from the Share Sheet

## Q: How do I remove the apps that get shown on the share sheet?

A: To customize / remove apps the share sheet, we use a [`PSPDFDocumentSharingConfiguration`][] object. It defines the set of options available when sharing documents and also includes an option for [`excludedActivityTypes`][] that will help us customize / remove any unwanted apps on the share sheet. Please note that it currently not possible to exclude all third party applications from the share sheet. This is a restriction of Apple's `UIActivityViewController`.

To remove unwanted apps from the share sheet, we would do something like this:

```swift
let sharingConfiguration = PSPDFDocumentSharingConfiguration.defaultConfiguration(forDestination: .activity).configurationUpdated {
    $0.excludedActivityTypes = [.assignToContact, .postToWeibo, .postToFacebook, .postToTwitter]
}

let sharingController = PSPDFDocumentSharingViewController(documents: [document])
sharingController.sharingConfigurations = [sharingConfiguration]
```

Now when the share sheet is shown, the activity types that we excluded will not be shown in the share sheet.

For a more detailed explanation on all the different customizations available for the share sheet, check out our [Document Sharing guide][]. We also have an example in our Catalog (`CustomSharingOptionsExample`) which demonstrates several different ways to customize the share sheet.
