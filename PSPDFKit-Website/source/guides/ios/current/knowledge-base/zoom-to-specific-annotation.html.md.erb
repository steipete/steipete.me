title: Zoom to a specific annotation when the PDF loads

## Q: When a PDF loads in PSPDFKit, we want to zoom in to a particular annotation.

A: You can zoom to an annotation by passing the annotation's bounding box to the `zoomToPDFRect:forPageAtIndex:animated:` method of `PSPDFDocumentViewController`.

```swift
class CustomPDFViewController: PSPDFViewController {
    override func viewDidAppear(_ animated: Bool) {
        super.viewDidAppear(animated)

        // Find the first annotation for demonstration purposes.
        guard let document = self.document, let annotation = document.annotationsForPage(at: 0, type: .all).first else {
            return
        }

        self.documentViewController!.zoom(toPDFRect: annotation.boundingBox, forPageAt: 0, animated: true)
    }
}
```

This has been tested with PSPDFKit 8.4 for iOS.
