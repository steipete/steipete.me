## Q: How do I customize the appearance of the navigation bar shown above the crop UI after taking a photo with the camera when adding an image annotation?

A: This navigation bar is part of `PSPDFImagePickerController`, which is a subclass of `UIImagePickerController`, which is a subclass of `UINavigationController`. You can use `UIAppearance` to customize all instances of this class like this:

```swift
UINavigationBar.appearance(whenContainedInInstancesOf: [PSPDFImagePickerController.self]).barTintColor = UIColor.yellow
```

If you need to access a particular instance of the picker controller, you could use the PSPDFViewController delegate method [`pdfViewController:shouldShowController:options:animated:`][].

This will look like this:
