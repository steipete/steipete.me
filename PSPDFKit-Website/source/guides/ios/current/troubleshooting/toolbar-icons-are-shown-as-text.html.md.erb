If this issue occurs, it means that the `PSPDFKit.bundle` either can’t be found or is outdated. Make sure you’ve added a version of the bundle that came with the version you’re currently using PSPDFKit with.

Xcode also sometimes holds on to caches, so follow these steps to clean them:

1. Perform “Clean” on your project.
2. Delete Xcode’s `DerivedData` folder.
3. Delete Xcode’s build folder.
4. Reset the iOS Simulator, or, if you deploy to a device, delete the old app.
5. Build again and see if the issue is still there.
