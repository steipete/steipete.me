title: PSPDFKit Doesnâ€™t Compile or Link
section: developers
---

The most common problem with linking PSPDFKit is that of missing frameworks. Make sure to either use the provided configuration files or to add all the frameworks listed in the [Integrating PSPDFKit Manually][] guide.

If you see an error like the following, it means `libxml2` is missing.

Other similar-looking linker errors will indicate other missing frameworks.

If there are syntax errors or compiler errors in the header, this is usually an indication that either Xcode is too old or you are using an unsupported/old SDK (e.g. by copying SDK 7 into Xcode 6, which somewhat works but is supported by neither Apple nor us).
