title: PSPDFKit.bundle Issues
section: developers

PSPDFKit needs various resources — such as images, character maps, bundles, and localization files — to work. For example, if your setup is unusual (e.g. using the Appcelerator Titanium plugin), you need to manually drag `PSPDFKit.bundle` into your application. It should be in your application bundle, but valid locations are also `Library` and `Documents`.

PSPDFKit will display both log warnings and, if a debugger is attached, an alert if there is an issue with the resource bundle.

The bundle is also internally versioned to make sure you don’t use an old bundle with a new version. In a case where you do, you might see a variation of the error asking you to update the bundle.
