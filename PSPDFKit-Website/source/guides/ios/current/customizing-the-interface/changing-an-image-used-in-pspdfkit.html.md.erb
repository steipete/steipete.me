title: Changing an Image Used in PSPDFKit
section: developers
---

The easiest way to change an image used in PSPDFKit would be to open up the `PSPDFKit.bundle` and replace files there, but it’s not the recommended way, and it’s hard to make sure you update this for each and every update we release.

The better way is to register a custom handler on the [`PSPDFKitGlobal`][] object via [`imageLoadingHandler`][]. This takes a block, gives you the image name, and allows you to return a custom image. If you return nothing, the default PSPDFKit image will be used. It’s best to set this block in the app delegate or before any `UIViewController` is on the screen. Images are cached, so a change made after caching will not do anything.

## Asset Catalog

[PSPDFKit 7 for iOS][] added vector images and support for asset catalogs. These images are located in `PSDPDFKitUI.framework/Assets.car` from `PSDPDFKitUI.xcframework`. You can use a tool like [Asset Catalog Tinkerer][] to browse the asset catalog.
