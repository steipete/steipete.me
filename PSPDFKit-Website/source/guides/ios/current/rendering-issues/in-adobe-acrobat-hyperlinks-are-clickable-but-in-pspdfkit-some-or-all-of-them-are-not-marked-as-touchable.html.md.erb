title: In Adobe Acrobat, Hyperlinks Are Clickable, but in PSPDFKit, Some or All of Them are Not Marked As Touchable

Adobe Acrobat and to some extent also Appleâ€™s Preview use custom in-text hyperlink detection to create annotations on the fly. This is nothing the PDF references specifies, but it's a common practice.

Since analyzing the page text can be expensive, this feature is disabled by default. Enable it via changing [`autodetectTextLinkTypes`][] to `PSPDFTextCheckingTypeAll`.
