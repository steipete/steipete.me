title: Undefined Symbols Error

If you get the following output when integrating PSPDFKit:

```
Undefined symbols for architecture i386:

"operator delete(void*)", referenced from:
___PSPDFInvokeRuntimePatches_block_invoke in PSPDFKit(PSPDFPatches.o)
"operator new(unsigned long)", referenced from:
___PSPDFInvokeRuntimePatches_block_invoke in PSPDFKit(PSPDFPatches.o)
ld: symbol(s) not found for architecture i386
clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)
```

Then youâ€™re missing the `-lc++` linker flag that has been required since PSPDFKit 4.2.0.

See the [Integrating PSPDFKit][] guide for details.
