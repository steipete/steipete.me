Our rendering component sometimes throws C++ exceptions as a part of normal operations.

These internal C++ exceptions are part of the normal render process. (In C++, exceptions are often used to control program flow, instead of just notifying you of exceptional issues like we do in Objective-C. This is all part of our renderer, so you should not worry about it.)

If you have breakpoints for all exceptions set, your workflow will be disrupted. We suggest only enabling Objective-C Exceptions in the Breakpoint Editor.
