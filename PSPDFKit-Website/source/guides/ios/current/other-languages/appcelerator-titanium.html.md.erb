[Appcelerator][] is a platform for creating great native mobile apps, all from a single JavaScript codebase.

# PSPDFKit for iOS as an Appcelerator PDF SDK

PSPDFKit is available as an Appcelerator Titanium Module and is a great choice for an Appcelerator PDF SDK. For working example code, see the `app.js` file, which is included in the module. We expose a practical subset of PSPDFKit features via the JavaScript bridge. All available features are listed in the `examples/app.js` file supplied with the module.

Currently, only the iOS SDK has an Appcelerator wrapper.

For install/build instructions, please take a look at the README in the [repository][].

### Configuring the Minimum Deployment Target

Inside your `tiapp.xml` file, make sure the minimum iOS version is correctly configured:

```xml
<ios>
  <min-ios-ver>11.0</min-ios-ver>
</ios>
```
