title: Migrating from Apple PDFKit
section: developers

order: 111
---

Apple's PDFKit provides a great starting point for integrating PDF
support into your iOS app. It is a system
library and as such the easiest to integrate.

PSPDFKit, on the other hand, is a cross-platform PDF framework with more advanced
features, fine-grained control over various aspects of PDF handling and a lot
of customization options, including:

* Advanced and native **UI & UX** with support for most PDF features
* Support for all **annotations** defined in the PDF specification
* Import & export of annotations in **JSON** and XFDF formats
* Accessing **files** embedded in documents
* Adding **watermarks** to documents
* Programmatic **form** filling
* Indexed full-text **search** (near-instant search results)
* Loading of documents from **custom sources**, with on-the-fly **decryption**
* Advanced, customizable **rendering** including CMYK color space support
* Custom **bookmarks** implementation (bookmarks are not part of the PDF spec)
* Available on multiple **platforms** with great **interoperability**
* Constantly **improving** with new features
* First class **support** directly from our engineers

To simplify migrating a code base from PDFKit to PSPDFKit as much as possible,
we provide a wrapper called [PDFXKit][]. It is a drop-in replacement with little
or no changes required allowing you to program against the PDFKit API while
using PSPDFKit under the hood. See Section [*Easy Transition with PDFXKit*](#easy-transition-with-pdfxkit)
for more info.

## Introduction

The PSPDFKit API can be overwhelming at first, especially when coming from Apple
PDFKit. But once you get through the basic concepts, it becomes straight
forward. We've traded a bit of simplicity for flexibility and performance. We
achieve this by using a couple of techniques and patterns.

For example, the responsibility for providing, parsing, and managing various
PDF objects and concepts is split into individual classes. Those are called
accordingly: `PSPDF...Provider`, `PSPDF...Parser`, `PSPDF...Manager`. We expose
those classes publicly in order to give you hooks for customization as well as
advanced control and performance optimization.

## Overview

The only UI classes provided by Apple's PDFKit is the `PDFView` and the
`PDFThumbnailView`. All remaining classes in Apple's PDFKit is what Apple calls
"utility classes". Let's take a look at those and how they relate to PSPDFKit.

The following table shows an overview of Apple's PDFKit classes that have a
roughly corresponding class in PSPDFKit:

| Apple's PDFKit                | PSPDFKit                       |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| [`PDFView`][]                     | [`PSPDFViewController`][]  |
| [`PDFThumbnailView`][]            | [`PSPDFScrubberBar`][]     |
| [`PDFDocument`][]                 | [`PSPDFDocument`][]                |
| [`PDFAnnotation`][]               | [`PSPDFAnnotation`][]              |
| [`PDFOutline`][]                  | [`PSPDFOutlineElement`][]          |

The [`PDFPage`][] class doesn't have a corresponding class in PSPDFKit, the concept
of a "page" is supported mainly via page indexes as described in more detail
in section [*Page Handling*](#page-handling).

The [`PDFSelection`][] class doesn't have a corresponding class in PSPDFKit. While
`PDFSelection` is very generic in Apple's PDFKit, covering multiple
use-cases, PSPDFKit offers more dedicated objects for each use case. Text
selected by a user is a UI concept. For more info, see Section [*Text Handling*](#text-handing).

## Document Handling

The [`PDFDocument`][] class in Apple PDFKit represents a single PDF document either
stored on disk as a file or loaded via an `NSData` object. This class
corresponds to [`PSPDFDocument`][] in PSPDFKit.

A [`PSPDFDocument`][] consists of one or more [`PSPDFDocumentProvider`][]'s. You can
think of one provider corresponding to a single file on disk. This allows you to
treat multiple PDF files as a single document in cases where you need it. Many
customers use this feature to split up large documents into individual files,
say to download each part individually on demand.

## Page Handling

As noted above, PSPDFKit doesn't have a corresponding class for [`PDFPage`][].
Anything related to a page is accessed via the document or a related object by
passing a page index. For example, you use [`PSPDFDocument`][]s
[`annotationsForPageAtIndex:type:`][] to get annotations for a specific page. Page
indexed access allows PSPDFKit to better optimize for performance.

The main object to manipulate pages of a document is the [`PSPDFDocumentEditor`][]
and related classes ([see announcement blog post](/blog/2016/the-document-editor/). It allows you to:

* Add pages
* Remove pages
* Duplicate pages
* Rotate pages
* Extracting pages (saving as a new PDF document)

Please consult the [Document Editing][] guide, Section [Programmatic Access][].

## Text Handing

Other than selecting text at the UI level, extracting text and inspecting
blocks of text are probably the two main use cases of [`PDFSelection`][] in Apple
PDFKit.

In PSPDFKit, both of these use cases are covered by [`PSPDFTextParser`][], which
you can access via the [`textParserForPageAtIndex:`][] method of [`PSPDFDocument`][].
It offers a simple API to get the text, glyphs ([`PSPDFGlyph`][]), words
([`PSPDFWord`][]), textBlocks ([`PSPDFTextBlock`][]) and even images ([`PSPDFImageInfo`][]).

In a PDF, text usually corresponds to glyphs positioned at an absolute location
on a specific page. PSPDFKit uses advanced heuristics to group these glyphs
into meaningful words and text blocks.

## Outline

The `PDFOutline` class encapsulates the outline concept of a PDF document.
PSPDFKit has a corresponding class named [`PSPDFOutlineElement`][] which works similarly to `PDFOutline`. You can access the outline via the [`outline`][] property on [`PSPDFDocument`][]:

[==

```swift
let document = /* Create a PSPDFDocument  */
let rootOutlineElement = document.outline
```

``` objc
PSPDFDocument *document = /* Create a PSPDFDocument  */;
PSPDFOutlineElement* rootOutlineElement = document.outline;
```

==]

Having the root outline element, you can walk the outline tree, get info, and
perform operations on the outline elements, similar to how you would do it with
[`PDFOutline`][]. For more info, please consult the [API
reference][API Reference iOS].

## Annotations

Apple PDFKit provides a single [`PDFAnnotation`][] class together with a small
[`PDFBorder`][] utility class representing annotations and their borders. PSPDFKit
supports all annotations as defined by the PDF specification with a very rich
and flexible API. We have an extensive guide covering all aspects of
annotations:
[Annotations Guide](https://pspdfkit.com/guides/ios/current/annotations/introduction-to-annotations/).

## Search

PSPDFKit offers two search options:

* **Regular search**: equivalent to Apple PDFKit, easy to use
* **Indexed full-text search**: blazing fast, requires more set-up

To perform a regular search for a document, create an instance of
[`PSPDFTextSearch`][], passing in the loaded [`PSPDFDocument`][] via its initializer.
Searching can be triggered via calling [`searchForString:`][], which will start a
search in a background queue. Implement [`PSPDFTextSearchDelegate`][] on the
receiving object and set the text search object's delegate to your object to be
notified of search result updates.

To learn more about our blazingly fast indexed full-text search, please take a
look at the [Indexed Full-Text Search](https://pspdfkit.com/guides/ios/current/features/indexed-full-text-search/) guide.

## Rendering

Apple PDFKit allows you to render a `PDFPage` into a specific context using
the `drawWithBox:toContext:` method. Similarly, the easiest way to render a
page with `PSPDFKit` is to use one of the following [`PSPDFDocument`][] methods:

[==

```swift
// PSPDFDocument
func imageForPage(at pageIndex: UInt, size: CGSize, clippedTo clipRect: CGRect, annotations: [PSPDFAnnotation]?, options: [PSPDFRenderOption : Any]? = nil) throws -> UIImage
func renderPage(at pageIndex: UInt, context: CGContext, size: CGSize, clippedTo clipRect: CGRect, annotations: [PSPDFAnnotation]?, options: [PSPDFRenderOption : Any]? = nil) throws
```

```objc
// PSPDFDocument
- (nullable UIImage *)imageForPageAtIndex:(NSUInteger)pageIndex size:(CGSize)size clippedToRect:(CGRect)clipRect annotations:(nullable NSArray<PSPDFAnnotation *> *)annotations options:(nullable NSDictionary<PSPDFRenderOption, id> *)options error:(NSError **)error;
- (BOOL)renderPageAtIndex:(NSUInteger)pageIndex context:(CGContextRef)context size:(CGSize)size clippedToRect:(CGRect)clipRect annotations:(nullable NSArray<PSPDFAnnotation *> *)annotations options:(nullable NSDictionary<PSPDFRenderOption, id> *)options error:(NSError **)error;
```

==]

Beyond this basic rendering support, PSPDFKit offers an advanced, asynchronous
rendering pipeline allowing you control various aspects of the rendering result
and performance. You first create a [`PSPDFRenderRequest`][] which specifies
what and how to render the page. You use that render request to create a
[`PSPDFRenderTask`][], set yourself as a delegate on that and schedule it in
a [`PSPDFRenderQueue`][]. Once finished, the render task will notify the delegate
and pass it the resulting image. See the [Rendering PDF Pages article][] for more details.

For more info on advanced rendering, please consult the [API
reference][API Reference iOS] for
those classes as well as our `PSPDFCatalog` example project. See the [example projects][] article for more details.

## Basic User Interface

As of iOS 11, PDFKit provides two UI classes for displaying and browsing PDF
files — [`PDFView`][] and [`PDFThumbnailView`][].

`PDFView` is the main UI class allowing you to display a PDF document
using different display modes and options to tweak the appearance. The
corresponding class in PSPDFKit is the [`PSPDFViewController`][].

[`PDFThumbnailView`][] is an accessory control for a `PDFView` showing a strip of
thumbnails for each page of the currently displayed PDF document. The
corresponding class in PSPDFKit is the [`PSPDFScrubberBar`][].

Unlike [`PDFView`][], the [`PSPDFViewController`][] is meant to be a drop-in
solution with very little code or UI required from your side. All you have to do
is create a [`PSPDFViewController`][] and present it as-is. Everything else is
handled for you automatically by default — including displaying the
[`PSPDFScrubberBar`][].

The following code snippet demonstrates how to display a PDF using
[`PSPDFViewController`][] and a thumbnail bar matching the one from PDFKit:

[==

```swift
import PSPDFKit

// Load the document.
let documentURL = Bundle.main.url(forResource: "Document", withExtension: "pdf")!
let document = PSPDFDocument(url: documentURL)

// Create a configuration object and tweak the thumbnail bar which will use
// the appropriate view, in this case the `PSPDFScrubberBar`.
let configuration = PSPDFConfiguration { builder in
    builder.thumbnailBarMode = .scrubberBar
    // Add your configuration options here.
}

// Put the PDF view controller inside a navigation controller in order to
// give it a navigation bar for various PDF-related controls.
let pdfViewController = PSPDFViewController(document: document, configuration: configuration)
let navigationController = UINavigationController(rootViewController: pdfViewController)

present(navigationController, animated: true)
```

```objc
#import <PSPDFKit/PSPDFKit.h>

// Load the document.
NSURL *documentURL = [NSBundle.mainBundle URLForResource:@"Document" withExtension:@"pdf"];
PSPDFDocument *document = [[PSPDFDocument alloc] initWithURL:documentURL];

// Create a configuration object and tweak the thumbnail bar which will use
// the appropriate view, in this case the `PSPDFScrubberBar`.
PSPDFConfiguration *configuration = [PSPDFConfiguration configurationWithBuilder:^(PSPDFConfigurationBuilder *builder) {
    builder.thumbnailBarMode = PSPDFThumbnailBarModeScrollable;
    // Add your configuration options here.
}];

// Put the PDF view controller inside a navigation controller in order to
// give it a navigation bar for various PDF-related controls.
PSPDFViewController *pdfViewController = [[PSPDFViewController alloc] initWithDocument:document configuration:configuration];
UINavigationController *navigationController = [[UINavigationController alloc] initWithRootViewController:pdfViewController];

[self presentViewController:navigationController animated:YES completion:NULL];
```

==]

The result should look something like this:

## Advanced User Interface

Apart from basic support for displaying and browsing PDFs with the two PDFKit
classes above, everything else needs to be implemented from scratch with PDFKit.
PSPDFKit on the other hand provides everything you need to handle PDFs in your
app, ready to be used out of the box.

When presented within a navigation controller, the `PSPDFViewController` puts a
couple of buttons into the navigation bar by default, giving you access to the
following features:

**Adding, deleting, and editing annotations**. The first button in the
navigation bar is by default the annotations button giving you access to
the annotation toolbar. Support of annotations is a big part of PSPDFKit, please
consult our [Annotations feature page](https://pspdfkit.com/guides/ios/current/annotations/introduction-to-annotations/)
as well as our [Annotations guide](https://pspdfkit.com/guides/ios/current/annotations/introduction-to-annotations/)
for an in-depth look.

**Searching & navigating search results**. Next to the annotations button
you'll find the loupe button, which presents the `PSPDFSearchViewController`.

**Displaying & managing the document outline, its annotations, bookmarks, and
files**. Next up is the bookmark button which gives you access to the `PSPDFOutlineViewController`,
`PSPDFBookmarkViewController`, `PSPDFAnnotationTableViewController`,
`PSPDFEmbeddedFilesViewController`. See our [Core Viewer](https://pspdfkit.com/pdf-sdk/ios/viewer/)
feature page for a visual walk-through of these features.

**Inserting, deleting, and reordering pages**. The last button in the navigation
bar gives you access to the `PSPDFThumbnailViewController` from which you get to
the `PSPDFDocumentEditorViewController` allowing you to manage the pages of
a document. See our [Document Editor feature page](https://pspdfkit.com/features/document-editor/ios/)
and the corresponding [Document Editing guide](https://pspdfkit.com/guides/ios/current/features/document-editor/) for more info.

PSPDFKit offers more UI components not directly accessible via the
[`PSPDFViewController`][] including the [`PSPDFDocumentPickerController`][] and the
[`PSPDFTabbedViewController`][]. All of these components are designed to be easy to
integrate and customize in order to perfectly blend into your app. To learn
more, please take a look at our [Customizing the Interface][] guide
as well as our extensive [documentation](https://pspdfkit.com/guides/ios/current/)
and [API reference](https://pspdfkit.com/guides/ios/current/).

## Easy Transition with PDFXKit

If your app is already using PDFKit, migrating the full code base to PSPDFKit
can be a major undertaking and a deal breaker for many developers. In this
case, we encourage you to give our [PDFXKit][] a try.

[PDFXKit is a drop-in replacement giving you the same API as PDFKit while using PSPDFKit under the hood](/blog/2017/introducing-pdfxkit/)
— only a few tweaks required. PDFXKit gives you full access to the underlying PSPDFKit allowing you take take advantage of all
PSPDFKit features, components, and tools if and when you need them.

PDFXKit is open source, please visit the [project page](https://github.com/PSPDFKit/PDFXKit) on GutHub for more info.

## Conclusion

Having experience with Apple PDFKit, by now you should have a rough idea on how
to translate that to PSPDFKit. If you have an existing codebase using
PDFKit, our PDFXKit makes the transition to PSPDFKit a breeze.

While PDFKit is a great starting point to add basic PDF support to your
app, PSPDFKit goes much further offering you a cross-platform drop-in solution
with many additional UI components, advanced PDF features, and first class
support directly from the developers.
