title: Getting the Currently Used Version

If you are unsure about the version of PSPDFKit you are using, there are ways to find out.

The current way to ask for the framework version at runtime is:

[==

```swift
let pspdfVersionString = PSPDFKitGlobal.versionString
```

```objc
NSString *pspdfVersionString = PSPDFKitGlobal.versionString;
```

==]

Another option is to open `PSPDFKit.framework` or `PSPDFKitUI.framework`. Inside, you will find the file `VERSION` with the version number inside.

**Note:** You are required to use the same version from the same disk image for both `PSPDFKit.framework` and `PSPDFKitUI.framework`.

Beginning with PSPDFKit 6.6.0 for iOS, the topmost folder in the downloaded disk image has the same name as the version of PSPDFKit in use.
