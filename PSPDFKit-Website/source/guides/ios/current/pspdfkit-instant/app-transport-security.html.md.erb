Instant must connect to your PSPDFKit Server to synchronize documents. You should use a secure `https` `serverURL` when creating the `PSPDFInstantClient` and ensure the server meets [Apple’s App Transport Security requirements][]. If this is not possible, ensure the appropriate ATS exceptions are set in the app's Info.plist.
