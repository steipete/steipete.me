PSPDFKit is a commercial product and uses a license key to verify your copy against the package name you have registered.

## Generate the License Key

To use a PSPDFKit license with your app, you have to generate a license key and bind it to the `applicationId` bundle ID of your app.

1. Log in to the [PSPDFKit Customer Portal](https://customers.pspdfkit.com/) using the credentials you received when purchasing PSPDFKit. You will see the list of all your purchased licenses.
2. Locate your license (e.g. “PSPDFKit for iOS”) and click the `Assign license key` button next to it. A dialog will open.
3. Enter the bundle ID of your production app. If you are unsure about this step, please read our [What Is a Bundle ID?][PSPDFKit Guide Bundle ID] guide first.
4. Click next and confirm your selected bundle ID. Please double-check that the chosen identifier matches the one configured in your app, as it can no longer be changed once it’s been set.

## Download the License Key

1. Log in to the [PSPDFKit Customer Portal](https://customers.pspdfkit.com/) using the credentials you received when purchasing PSPDFKit. You will see the list of all your purchased licenses.
2. Locate your license (e.g. “PSPDFKit for Android”) and click the `License Key` button next to it. If there is no such button, you probably need to generate the license key first.
3. A dialog will open showing you a code snippet with your license key.
4. After copying the license key over to your project, the PSPDFKit SDK is ready to use.

## Using the License Key

It is important that you set the license key before using any PSPDFKit classes:

[==

```swift
func application(_ application: UIApplication, willFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplicationLaunchOptionsKey : Any]? = nil) -> Bool {
    PSPDFKitGlobal.setLicenseKey("YOUR_LICENSE_KEY_GOES_HERE")
    return true
}
```

```objc
- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application willFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {
    // Set your license key here. PSPDFKit is commercial software.
    // Each PSPDFKit license is bound to a specific app bundle ID.
    // Visit http://customers.pspdfkit.com to get your demo or commercial license key.
    [PSPDFKitGlobal setLicenseKey:@"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY_GOES_HERE"];

    return YES;
}
```

==]

If you are using storyboards, you may have to set the license key in `main.m` so that it gets called even before `willFinishLaunchingWithOptions`:

```objc
#import <UIKit/UIKit.h>
#import "AppDelegate.h"

@import PSPDFKit;

int main(int argc, char * argv[]) {
    @autoreleasepool {
        [PSPDFKitGlobal setLicenseKey:@"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY_GOES_HERE"];
        return UIApplicationMain(argc, argv, nil, NSStringFromClass([AppDelegate class]));
    }
}
```
