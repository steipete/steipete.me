PSPDFKit ships with a few projects containing a lot of examples to help you with your code.
You can find these projects in the `Examples` folder of the `.dmg` file you downloaded from your [customer portal][] or in the demo download.

What follows is a rundown of the example projects and what they contain.

## PSPDFCatalog

This project contains most of the examples. Here you can find Objective-C and Swift sample code for:

* [`PSPDFViewController`][] customizations
* Toolbar customizations
* Annotation processing with [`PSPDFProcessor`][]
* Document editing with [`PSPDFDocumentEditor`][]
* Multimedia annotations like videos and GIFs
* Forms and digital signatures
* Security-related topics like encryption and password protection
* Import/Export formats like XFDF and JSON
* ...and lots of other use cases.

> **Tip:** PSPDFCatalog also contains the “Kiosk Grid” example, which lets you open every document contained in the `Samples` folder. This means you just have to put your document into the `Samples` and you can open it in the kiosk example, with no customizations needed.

## PSPDFSimple

This showcases a very common use case of presenting a PDF using a [`PSPDFViewController`][] subclass in a storyboard. This very simple project should help you get started.

## SwiftExample

This project is written in Swift 4 and contains code for simple use cases of [`PSPDFProcessor`][] and [`PSPDFLibrary`][].
