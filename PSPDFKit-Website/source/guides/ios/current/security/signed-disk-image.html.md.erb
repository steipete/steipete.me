title: Signed Disk Image

Since PSPDFKit v5.4.0 we're using a Developer ID signed disk image to distribute our framework.  
Signing disk images is only possible since OS X 10.11.5.  
It allows the entire disk image to be validated by Gatekeeper the first time it's mounted.  
For more information see [TN2206 "Signing Disk Images"][Apple Guide Signing Disk Images].

You can verify that the PSPDFKit disk image was indeed created by us by displaying information about it with `codesign`:

```
$ codesign -dvvv PSPDFKit.dmg
```

The output should look like the following:

```
Executable=/Users/pspdfkit/PSPDFKit.dmg
