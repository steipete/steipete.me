title: Encrypt or Decrypt Files on the Server
section: developers

We have a standalone command-line tool written in Go, so it will work on Windows, Mac, and Linux/Unix.

Itâ€™s in the distribution dmg under `Extras/cryptor-cli`.

## Building

To build the `cryptor-cli` on your system, follow these steps:

1.  [Install Go][]. On macOS and Windows, package installers are available, and on Linux, you have to build from source.
2.  `cd` to the `cryptor-cli` directory.
3.  Type `go build`.

## Usage

```sh
./cryptor-cli -h
Usage of ./cryptor-cli:
 -f=false: force overwrite of output file
 -in="": input file
 -o="encrypt": operation, can be [encrypt, decrypt]
 -out="": output file
 -p="": passphrase
 -s="": salt (optional)
```

### Encrypt Example

```sh
./cryptor-cli -o "encrypt" -in "path/to/original.pdf" -out "path/to/encrypted" -p "test123" -s "salt"
```

### Decrypt Example

```sh
./cryptor-cli -o "decrypt" -in "path/to/encrypted" -f -out "path/to/decrypted.pdf" -p "test123" -s "salt"
```
