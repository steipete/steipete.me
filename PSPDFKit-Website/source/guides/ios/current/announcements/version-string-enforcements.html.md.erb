title: Version String Enforcements

In late October of 2015, Apple unexpectedly changed how bundle version strings (`CFBundleShortVersionString`) appear when uploading apps to iTunes Connect. Now, versions must contain no more than three dot-separated numbers.

When uploading an app with an incorrect version string, the following error might pop up.

We shipped PSPDFKit 5 using the version string `ios-5.0.0`, but itâ€™s no longer a valid version. Starting with PSPDFKit 5.0.1 (28 October 2015), we changed the version string to `5.0.1`.

If you need to ship an older version, you can edit `Info.plist` in PSPDFKit to only include dot-separated numbers (e.g. deleting the `ios-` part).
