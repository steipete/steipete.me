iOS 9 tries to open YouTube links within the YouTube app, but only if your app is configured correctly.

## The Issue

If your document contains `https://youtube.com` links they will open up in a webpage like other links.
This changes when the YouTube app is installed. Then iOS tries to open the YouTube app, but fails with a "No handler found for https://youtube.com/..." alert. Additionally you will see the following log message:

```
-canOpenURL: failed for URL: "youtube://www.youtube.com/..." - error: "This app is not allowed to query for scheme youtube"
```

## The Solution

In order for your app to be allowed to query for the `youtube` scheme you need to add a `LSApplicationQueriesSchemes` key to your `Info.plist` containing the scheme you want to allow:

After that you can tap on a YouTube link and an alert will appear, asking if you want to open the link in the YouTube app or not.
