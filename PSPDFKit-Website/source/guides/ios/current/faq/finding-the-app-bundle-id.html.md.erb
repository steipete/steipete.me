title: Finding the App Bundle ID
section: developers
---

There is no way to look up [bundle IDs][pspdfkit guides bundle id] in the Apple iOS App Store directly. To find the identifier, you will need to look at a file inside the app.

## If Your App Is in the App Store

1. Find the app online (google for the iTunes link). For this example, we use [Apple Pages][].
2. Copy the number after the ID in the URL (here it’s 361309726).
3. Open https://itunes.apple.com/lookup?id=361309726, replacing the ID with the one you looked up.
4. Search the output for bundleID. In this example, it looks like this (next to a bunch of other data): `"bundleId":"com.apple.Pages"`. So for Apple, the bundle ID is `com.apple.Pages`.

## If You Have the IPA File Directly

1. Copy the `.ipa` file and rename the extension to `.zip`. (So, for example, `Pages.ipa` will become `Pages.zip`.)
2. Unzip the ZIP file. You will get a new folder named the same way as the original ZIP file.
3. Search for the `iTunesMetadata.plist` file in that new folder.
4. Open the file with a text editor and search for `softwareVersionBundleId`. For example, for the Pages app, the bundle ID is `com.apple.Pages`.

You can also use iTunes to download the app `.ipa` file directly and then find the bundle ID, like shown below.

## If You Only Have the App on Your Phone

1. Use a tool like [iExplorer][], which allows you to browse your device storage directly.
2. Connect your iPhone/iPad to your Mac via USB and open iExplorer or a similar utility.
3. Open the Apps folder on your device and locate the app you’re interested in.
4. Locate the `iTunesMetadata.plist` file and follow the steps above that you used to unpack the `.ipa` file.

As of PSPDFKit 5 for iOS, [you can use this technique to identify the SDK version as well][pspdfkit guides current version].
