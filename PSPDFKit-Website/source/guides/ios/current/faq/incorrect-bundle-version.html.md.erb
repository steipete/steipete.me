title: Incorrect Bundle Version
section: developers

While running your app after updating PSPDFKit, you may encounter a popover saying that the version of the `PSPDFKit.bundle` you’re using does not match the version expected in PSPDFKit. This is an Xcode problem and is not caused by PSPDFKit.

When you see this happening, deleting Xcode’s `Derived Data`, located at `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData`, will solve the problem.
