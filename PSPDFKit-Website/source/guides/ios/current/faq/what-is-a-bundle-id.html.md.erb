title: What Is a Bundle ID?
section: developers
---

Every iOS app requires an App ID to work. This is a string that is set up during development, usually in the form of `com.your-company.app-name`. Please note that the terms App ID and bundle ID are generally used interchangeably.

PSPDFKit bases your license on the bundle ID you provide. This has to be an explicit ID, meaning an ID that is unique and does not contain a star (\*) value.

Once a bundle ID is registered in the PSPDFKit license portal, it can’t be changed. Please note that these IDs are case-sensitive, so make sure you register the correct case variant.

**ℹ️ Note:** [You can learn more about the difference between a wildcard App ID and an explicit App ID here][apple guide wildcard app id].

There is generally no limitation from Apple on how many App IDs you can create in the Apple Developer Portal. End users do not see this ID unless they are technically very advanced and manually open your App Bundle.

See our [Finding the App Bundle ID][pspdfkit guide finding bundle id] guide article if you are unsure about the bundle ID of your app.

## Development and Testing

For development and testing, you can request additional bundle IDs [from our license portal][pspdfkit backend]. Please ensure that you have registered the actual bundle ID beforehand, and that the beta/testing ID is recognizable as such.

Example:

If your product is named FaxSender and your company name is OKBX Corporation, then your bundle ID will likely look like this: `com.okbx.fax-sender`. Your testing IDs could be `com.okbx.fax-sender.dev`, `com.okbx.fax-sender.staging`, `com.okbx.fax-sender.testing`, or `com.okbx.fax-sender.beta`.

We approve these IDs manually and will add them if they match the above scheme. If you have a different scheme, please let us know and we will consider your case.

If you can’t find the Request Beta ID link, you either have no license entry (which could mean your payment is open/pending), or you haven’t yet registered your actual bundle ID with your license. Please complete your payment or register your bundle ID and the Beta ID request feature will work.

## Enterprise Considerations

If you distribute your app in multiple [enterprise app stores][apple enterprise], it would technically be possible to use the same App ID across them. However, this loophole is closed by our license agreement. If you need to deploy your applications in multiple stores, please contact us so we can figure out a solution.

## iOS Extensions (App Extensions, Notification Widgets)

[App extensions][] are a new feature as of iOS 8, and these will need a separate bundle ID, which requires an additional license. However, we might be able to offer a discount if you explain your extension use case. Please note that iOS 10 adds [notification widgets][], which also require a separate license.
