title: Configuring Editable/Visible Annotation Types
section: developers
---

By default, PSPDFKit will render all known annotation types. See `PSPDFAnnotation.h` for a full list of the available types.

There are two main definition types used in PSPDFKit: [`PSPDFAnnotationType`][] as an integer bitmask with all PDF types as defined in the PDF spec (e.g. `PSPDFAnnotationTypeInk`), and a string variant that is better suited for arrays ([`PSPDFAnnotationStringInk`][]).

There are also some special annotation types that correspond to subtypes (e.g. [`PSPDFAnnotationStringSignature`][] is actually of type `PSPDFAnnotationTypeInk` but is handled differently in the framework). Additionally, there are some features masked as annotation types, such as [`PSPDFAnnotationStringEraser`][] or [`PSPDFAnnotationStringSelectionTool`][]. (See `PSPDFAnnotationStateManager.h` for all definitions).

## Hiding Specific Annotation Types

The [`renderAnnotationTypes`][] property controls which annotations are rendered. It’s a bitmask, and it defaults to `PSPDFAnnotationTypeAll`.

To just allow highlights and drawings to be rendered, configure the document like this:

[==

```swift
document.renderAnnotationTypes = [.highlight, .ink]
```

```objc
document.renderAnnotationTypes = PSPDFAnnotationTypeHighlight|PSPDFAnnotationTypeInk;
```

==]

You should configure this property before the document is presented in a [`PSPDFViewController`][]. If you change it afterward, either call [`reloadData`][] or, as a faster and more fine-grained approach, call [`updateView`][] on all visible page views:

[==

```swift
for pageView in pdfController.visiblePageViews {
    pageView.update()
}
```

```objc
[pdfController.visiblePageViews makeObjectsPerformSelector:@selector(updateView)];
```

==]

When changing the visible annotations after a document has already been rendered — either in a previous session or when the document is presented right away — you need to clear the cache for this document by calling `-[PSPDFCache removeCacheForDocument:]`.

## Disabling All Annotations

With the [`annotationsEnabled`][] property on [`PSPDFDocument`][], annotations can be completely disabled. Note that links are also annotations, and you almost never want to disable links. There are, however, valid use cases, so this is an option. Changing this also requires a call to [`reloadData`][] if the document is already displayed. When enabling or disabling annotations after the document has already been rendered — either in a previous session or when the document is presented right away — you need to clear the cache for this document by calling `-[PSPDFCache removeCacheForDocument:]`.

## Control Which Types Can Be Edited/Created

The [`editableAnnotationTypes`][] property controls which annotation types can be edited. It’s a set containing annotation string types (e.g. [`PSPDFAnnotationStringInk`][]).

The annotation toolbar will only display items that are in [`editableAnnotationTypes`][], but it also has [its own configuration][pspdfkit guide customizing the annotation toolbar].

The annotation creation menu that appears on a long tap has a [different configuration as well][pspdfkit guide customizing menus].
