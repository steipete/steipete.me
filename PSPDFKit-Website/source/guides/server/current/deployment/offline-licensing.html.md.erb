PSPDFKit Server is a commercial product, and each installation requires a valid license to work.

The following steps describe the process of configuring the server for offline licensing.

1.  In the customer portal, click on the desired installation of the product to view its license
    details. **Ensure that you assign Web Domain to your license.**
    You will see your custom `LICENSE_KEY` value if offline licensing is enabled for the installation in question.

2.  Copy the value of `LICENSE_KEY` into the `LICENSE_KEY` environment variable of your deployment of
    PSPDFKit Server. When using the `docker-compose.yml` file, simply put the value under the
    `LICENSE_KEY` key, as shown here:

         version: '2'

         services:
           pspdfkit:
             environment:
               # License key for offline licensing.
               LICENSE_KEY: |
                 <your custom license key value goes here>

         [...]

    Note that either `ACTIVATION_KEY` or `LICENSE_KEY` can be used, but not both.

3.  Start the server and check that the following message has been printed in the console:

         Using the offline license from LICENSE_KEY.

    This means the license has been configured successfully.

4.  You can see the status of your license in the [dashboard].
    Close to the expiration date, a warning will be displayed in the dashboard, along with
    instructions on how to renew the license.
