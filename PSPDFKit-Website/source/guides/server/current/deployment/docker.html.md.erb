[Docker][] is a set of products that uses operating-system-level virtualization to develop and deliver software in packages called [containers][].

**Docker containers run on all modern platforms** (Windows 10, Windows Server 2016/2019, macOS 10.12+, Linux kernel 3.10 or higher), and there are various container runtimes available. Docker containers are also **supported on basically any cloud host** (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, DigitalOcean, and more).

Docker containers can be based on Windows or Linux. PSPDFKit Server is a Linux-based Docker container.

The most common way to run a Docker container is via Docker Engine. [Docker Engine][] is the industry-leading container runtime. Docker offers a [free community version][] and a commercial enterprise version. Most of our partners do not need the enterprise version. However, it can be useful if your business requires an SLA support agreement.

## Running Docker on Linux

Docker containers are fully supported on Linux.

## Running Docker in the Cloud

Docker containers are supported by all major cloud providers.

We recommend using [Docker Machine][], [Kubernetes][], or native Docker implementations by cloud providers like [Amazon Web Services][], [Google Cloud][], or [Microsoft Azure][] for deployment in production.

## Running Docker on Windows Server 2016/2019

Docker officially supports Windows Server 2016/2019 only with its Enterprise Edition (EE). [See the official documentation for details][docker documentation]. The [Community Edition (CE)][] requires Microsoft Windows 10 Professional or Enterprise 64-bit. There are [various][] [ways][] to get around this (arbitrary) restriction, but we cannot offer support for these.

Alternatively, you can use [Docker Toolbox][], which has lower system requirements and will work on Server.

## Running Docker on Virtualized Windows

If you provide your solution via a Windows virtual machine, you can still run Docker. Docker for Windows (Docker Engine) requires [Hyper-V][], which is supported by some virtualization products. While [Oracle VirtualBox][] does not support nested virtualization, [VMware Workstation][] and [Parallels][] do support this feature (see [this tutorial][] for information on how to enable Hyper-V on VMware).

If Hyper-V is not available in your setup, you can choose [Docker Toolbox][], which [doesn’t require a hypervisor][] to run.

## Other Technologies

**[Docker Toolbox][]** is a legacy runtime for older Mac and Windows systems that does not require Hyper-V (Windows) or hypervisor kit (Mac) to run. It uses VirtualBox under the hood, which is slightly slower than the modern Docker Engine. Docker Toolbox runs on Windows Server 2016/2019 and Windows 7/8/8.1/10.

**Docker on Windows** is a technology that allows Windows Docker containers to run directly on Windows Server 2016/2019 via a Windows container host. This doesn’t run PSPDFKit Server, as it is a Linux Docker container. Microsoft created [Hyper-V isolation (LCOW)][] to run Linux containers on Windows, and it [shipped][] in the Windows 10 Fall Creators Update and in Windows Server 1709.

[Docker for Windows is in the process of being replaced][] by [WSL 2][]. WSL 2 is the new Windows Subsystem for Linux that runs an actual Linux kernel and thus offers full Linux compatibility. Docker will use WSL 2 in the future to run containers on it directly, offering higher performance than with current solutions. A [preview of Docker Desktop for WSL 2 is available for download][].
