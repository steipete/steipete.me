In addition to the [Server-to-Server API][], PSPDFKit Server also provides an HTTP API that can be directly used in the browser to:

- [Render a cover image of a document into an `<img>` tag](../../client-api/render-images)
- [Download a document as a PDF](../../client-api/download-pdfs)

Both endpoints require the query parameter `jwt` for authentication. Please refer to the [Client Authentication][] guide for information on how to generate a valid JSON Web Token (JWT).
