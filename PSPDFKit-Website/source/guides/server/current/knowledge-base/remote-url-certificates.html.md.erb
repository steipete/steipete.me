Question: What to do when I can't upload document from a URL because of the 'Unknown CA' error or other issues related to SSL certificates?

Answer:

In order to upload a document from a URL, PSPDFKit Server needs to make an HTTP request to fetch it from the given server. It's unable to complete this request due to invalid, expired, or malformed SSL certificates.

The most common issues related to the certificates are:
- certificate is expired
- certificates in a chain are not ordered correctly

If you encounter issues related to SSL certificates, we recommend checking your certificates with SSL Labs online tool: https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/.
