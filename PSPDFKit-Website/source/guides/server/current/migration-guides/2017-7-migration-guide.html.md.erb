[PSPDFKit Server 2017.7][] changes how assets (uploaded PDF files and attachments) are stored.

The new default (built-in) asset storage stores the PDFs as Binary Large OBjects (BLOBs) in the configured Postgres database. Because it is not compatible with multiple running nodes, using a Docker volume as asset storage (local) is deprecated and will be removed with version 2017.8.

When you have not defined the [asset storage][] backend with the environment variable `ASSET_STORAGE_BACKEND`, PSPDFKit Server now defaults to built-in asset storage.

If you have not set the `ASSET_STORAGE_BACKEND` option, you have to either set it to local, which was the old default value, or [migrate][] to the new default built-in asset storage. Be aware that the `local` option was **deprecated** in 2017.7 and will be removed in a future version of PSPDFKit Server.

### Migration Instructions

To migrate from a local Docker volume to built-in asset storage, make sure you have set `ASSET_STORAGE_PATH` to the path where the assets currently reside.

In the same directory, where you have your `docker-compose` file, run:

```bash
docker-compose run pspdfkit pspdfkit assets:migrate:from-local-to-built-in
```

If you are running the Docker container without Docker Compose, run:

```bash
docker exec <container-name> pspdfkit assets:migrate:from-local-to-built-in
```

Make sure to replace `<container-name>` with the name of your PSPDFKit Docker container.
To list all Docker containers and their names, run:

```bash
docker ps -a
```
