PSPDFKit Server will move away from generating numeric IDs for documents and move to randomized unique IDs (ULIDs). This will improve scalability for users with a very large number of documents.

[As part of 2018.7][blog post], we have introduced the `GENERATE_ULID_DOCUMENT_IDS` environment variable, which determines whether new documents are assigned a (deprecated) numeric ID or a ULID. Enabling this setting will give you the opportunity to test this change before its deprecation.

Please be aware that when uploading a document, you [can also supply your own document ID][own document id] that will be used by PSPDFKit Server.

While the automatically assigned document ID has always been a string, up until now, it could always be converted to an integer.

We highly recommend you either migrate to ULIDs as document IDs or [supply your own][own document id] when creating documents.

Our next release (2019.1) will deprecate numeric IDs and default to using ULIDs as IDs.

### Migration Instructions

- When [configuring PSPDFKit Server][] set `GENERATE_ULID_DOCUMENT_IDS=true`.
