[PSPDFKit for Web 2018.6][blog post] introduced support for stamp annotations with predefined stamps and added a new bookmark sidebar.

### Notable Changes

- Previous versions of PSPDFKit Server saved assets for stamp annotations, but these are no longer needed. To delete these unused assets from the asset storage, the cleanup API endpoint `POST api/cleanup` can be used:

  **Request**

  ```curl
  $ curl http://localhost:5000/api/cleanup \
    -X POST \
    -H "Authorization: Token token=<secret token>" \
  ```

  **Response**

  ```
  HTTP/1.1 200 OK
  content-length: 2
  cache-control: max-age=0, private, must-revalidate

  OK
  ```
