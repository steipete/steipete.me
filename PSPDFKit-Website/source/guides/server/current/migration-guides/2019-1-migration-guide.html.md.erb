⚠️ PSPDFKit Server now uses randomized unique IDs (ULIDs) for documents instead of numeric IDs. This improves scalability for users with a large number of documents.

[As part of 2019.1][blog post], we require the explicit setting of the `GENERATE_ULID_DOCUMENT_IDS` environment variable ([introduced in 2018.7][2018.7 blog post]) for all installations from before 31 January 2019. The variable determines whether new documents are assigned a (deprecated) numeric ID or a ULID.

Please be aware that when uploading a document, you [can also supply your own document ID][own document id] that will be used by PSPDFKit Server.

While the automatically assigned document ID has always been a string, up until now, it could be converted to an integer.

We highly recommend you either migrate to ULIDs by setting `GENERATE_ULID_DOCUMENT_IDS` to `true` or [supply your own document ID][own document id] when creating documents.

### Migration Instructions

- When [configuring PSPDFKit Server][], set `GENERATE_ULID_DOCUMENT_IDS=true`.
