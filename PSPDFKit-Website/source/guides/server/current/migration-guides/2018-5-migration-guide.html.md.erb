[PSPDFKit for Web 2018.5][blog post] adds image annotations to place arbitrary images on a PDF page, along with two new sidebar modes â€” one to show the table of contents (document outlines) of a PDF, and one that lists all annotations. It also includes a new option to create annotation variants with the new ink highlighter and arrow tools enabled by default, plus a whole lot more!

### Notable Changes

- We changed the `verticalAlign` attribute value of text annotations from `middle` to `center` in our [JSON spec][].
- We added support to configure the amount of database connections via the `DATABASE_CONNECTIONS` environment variable.
