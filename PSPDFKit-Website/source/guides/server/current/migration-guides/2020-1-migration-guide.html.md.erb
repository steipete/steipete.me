[This release][] introduces support for [Digital Signatures][] and [Instant Comments][].

With the introduction of these new features, Server APIs for [verifying the signature status of][] and [signing][] a document or a specific layer have been added. Note that the digital signature status is only available for documents that have been uploaded after youâ€™ve upgraded to the new version. If you have previously uploaded digitally signed documents to PSPDFKit Server, the signatures will not appear.

The new Server APIs for Instant Comments allow you to [add][add comments] and [view][view comments] comments in any document or layer. This version also introduces a new annotation type: [comment marker][]. Existing [annotation APIs][] now allow you to fetch, create, update, and delete comment markers. If you expect only a strict set of annotation types being returned by those APIs, make sure to include the comment marker in that set when you decide to use Instant Comments.

You can now access an experimental API explorer page, which is available from the Server dashboard. The explorer includes documentation for all available Server APIs and allows you to interactively issue requests and inspect responses.

On the operational side, PSPDFKit Server is now able to correctly connect to a Postgres database over TLS, as well as establish a secure connection to Redis.
