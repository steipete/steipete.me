[PSPDFKit Server 2018.1][] adds support for importing and exporting XFDF and Instant JSON files and improves validation of your configuration settings.

### Necessary Steps When Upgrading PSPDFKit Server

PSPDFKit Server no longer allows you to use the default `SECRET_KEY_BASE` value `secret-key-base`. If you were using the default value, please note that youâ€™ll have to change your configuration. Otherwise, PSPDFKit Server will abort the startup. Take a look at the [configuration overview][] for more information about our configuration options.

### Notable Changes

- PSPDFKit now supports importing and exporting of [XFDF][] and [Instant JSON][] files. Take a look at the Importing Exporting section to find out more about each format.

  - When [uploading documents][], you can include an additional `attachment` file, which in turn will be imported into the uploaded PDF.
  - There are two new endpoints, [`api/documents/:document_id/document.json`][] and [`api/documents/:document_id/document.xfdf`][], which will export an Instant JSON and XFDF file of the document, respectively.

### Migrate PSPDFKit for Web
