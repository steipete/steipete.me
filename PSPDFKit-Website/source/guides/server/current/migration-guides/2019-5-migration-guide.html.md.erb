**[This release][] removes support for API version 2017.6.**

This change affects the following endpoints:

- [Adding an Annotation to a Document][]
- [Adding an Annotation with an Attachment to a Document][]
- [Updating an Existing Annotation][]
- [Updating an Existing Annotation with an Attachment][]

If youâ€™re using any of the above endpoints and manually setting the `pspdfkit-api-version` header, please make sure you update your application code to follow the examples included in the documentation.

A more explicit API for [downloading the PDF file associated with a specific layer][] has been added, thereby deprecating the approach that uses the [document specific endpoint][] with a `:layer_name` query string parameter.

#### Migrate PSPDFKit for Web
