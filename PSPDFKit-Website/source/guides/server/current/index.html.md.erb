## High-Level Overview

PSPDFKit Server is our server-side component used by [PSPDFKit for Web][] and [PSPDFKit Instant][]. It is delivered as a [Docker container][] that you deploy to your own infrastructure. Your PSPDFKit-powered apps then connect to it.

The server requires a PostgreSQL database and dedicated file storage, the latter of which can be either a local Docker volume, any S3-compatible object storage, or the Postgres database itself.

- **PSPDFKit for Web**

  PSPDFKit Server preprocesses uploaded documents into a format that PSPDFKit for Web can render and stores annotations. PSPDFKit for Web intelligently downloads pages on demand, so even large documents can be browsed quickly.

  More information can be found in the [PSPDFKit for Web guides][].

- **PSPDFKit Instant**

  As with PSPDFKit for Web, PSPDFKit Server stores uploaded documents and annotations. PSPDFKit for Android, iOS, and Web connect to PSPDFKit Server to synchronize annotations and download documents.

  More information can be found in the guides for each platform.

## Document Management

Users upload documents to your backend, which simply forwards the uploaded PDF file to PSPDFKit Server. In return, it receives a document identifier. In your server, you only have to store this identifier; we store the PDF document, its annotations, and the meta information.

The PDFs are stored in the asset storage, which can be one of the supported [asset storage backends][]. PSPDFKit Server also supports [adding documents from URLs][], which means PDFs are not stored in an asset storage and instead get fetched from the URLs whenever the server needs them.

We regularly release new updates, which will be announced via [Twitter][], our [blog][], and a [newsletter you can subscribe to][newsletter].

Please see the [changelog](https://pspdfkit.com/changelog/server/) for details of what is new in each release.

If you experience any problems with PSPDFKit Server, please look at our [Troubleshooting][] section or [contact support][pspdfkit support].
