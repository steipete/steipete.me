PSPDFKit Server comes with a built-in dashboard that makes it easier to both see what’s going on in your production installation and improve your developer experience.

It is available at `/dashboard`. If you’re testing PSPDFKit Server locally, you can follow the [Setting Up PSPDFKit Server guide][] and access the dashboard at http://localhost:5000/dashboard. You can configure the required HTTP credentials in `docker-compose.yml`.

## Use Cases

The dashboard allows you to quickly:

- Inspect the runtime environment.
- Create new documents (useful while integrating PSPDFKit for Web into your application).
- Access a link to our current documentation and guides.
- Validate your generated JWTs.

For interacting with the server programmatically, you can use the [backend API][pspdfkit managing documents].

## Authentication

The dashboard is secured using HTTP authentication. You can modify the username and password via the environment variables configured in your `docker-compose.yml` file:

- `DASHBOARD_USERNAME`
- `DASHBOARD_PASSWORD`

To disable the dashboard, leave these environment variables blank, or don’t set them.
