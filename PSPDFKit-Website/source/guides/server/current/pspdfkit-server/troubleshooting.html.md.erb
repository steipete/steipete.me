## Common Issues

### Accessing the Error Log

PSPDFKit Server will pipe useful logging information to the attached [standard streams][], stdout and stderr. When you submit a bug report, always make sure to include the relevant lines.

Accessing this information depends on your [deployment option][deployment]. If you have started PSPDFKit Server locally, you can open the terminal window the server is running in to see the output.

In production, you can use [`docker logs`][] or a similar tool, depending on your deployment option.

If the log does not contain useful information, you can try to set the log level to `debug` with the `LOG_LEVEL` environment variable.

### Invalid Token

When receiving the error “Invalid Token,” you can debug and verify your token on [jwt.io][]. You’ll also get an error in the server log, where you can see if the token has expired or if the user has no access for the given document.

### Running PSPDFKit Server with Docker Toolbox

Docker Toolbox is for older versions of Mac and Windows, and we recommend updating to [Docker for Mac][] or [Docker for Windows][] if possible.

When running PSPDFKit Server on [Docker Toolbox][], it won’t be reachable with `localhost`, because Docker Toolbox is running a Linux VM in VirtualBox.

To get the IP address of your Docker machine, which can be used instead of `localhost`, run the following:

```shell
docker-machine ip
```

### The Server Does Not Start Due To a `Pending migration` Error

This error occurs when the server is not able to do database migrations. Make sure you use Postgres 9.6 or newer, as older versions of Postgres are not supported.

### Issue When Running on Windows: Pulling from PSPDFKit Image Operating System “Linux” Cannot Be Used on This Platform

This may happen when your Docker engine is configured to run Windows containers and PSPDFKit Server is packaged as a Linux image. We recommend installing [Docker for Windows][], which adds a thin VM that can run Linux containers. See [this issue][docker issue 27668] on Docker’s issue tracker for more technical details.

Learn more in our [Docker guide][].
