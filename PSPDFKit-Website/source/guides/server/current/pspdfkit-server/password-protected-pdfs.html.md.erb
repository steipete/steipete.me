## Password-Protected PDFs

With the release of 2018.3, PSPDFKit Server added support for password-protected PDFs.

### Upstream API Access

To access password-protected documents via the upstream API, add the `pspdfkit-pdf-password` header to your API calls.

Please refer to our [API Endpoints for Working with Documents guide][] for more detailed instructions on how to access password-protected PDFs documents.

### Client Access

Clients can access password-protected PDFs by using a JSON Web Token (JWT) that includes the `password` claim, or by supplying the password when [opening or loading a document][password-protected pdfs guide].
