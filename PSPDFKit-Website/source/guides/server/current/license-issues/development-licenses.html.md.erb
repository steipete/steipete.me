PSPDFKit for Web and PSPDFKit Server can be activated with a production or development key.

When running PSPDFKit Server as part of your development environment, QA, or staging deployment, you must use a development key as opposed to a production key.

A development key does not restrict the allowed `Origin`, which allows you to test and develop conveniently.

You can get the development key from the [PSPDFKit Customer Portal][]:
