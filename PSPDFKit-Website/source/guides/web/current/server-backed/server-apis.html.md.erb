We offer a broad range of APIs to fully control PSPDFKit Server. These APIs are split into two different categories:

- [Server-to-Server APIs][] — These APIs are meant to be called from your existing backend. They can be used to upload and control documents, annotations, PDF forms, and more.
- [Client-to-Server APIs][] — These APIs can be called from the browser and are used to embed preview images into an `<img>` element or to provide a link to download a PDF.

In addition to the Server APIs, you can use the full range of our PSPDFKit for Web [JavaScript APIs][].
