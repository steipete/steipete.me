This guide will walk you through setting up a local development instance of PSPDFKit Server and integrating it with your web app.

This process requires a working license.

**Accessing license information — for evaluation**

After [requesting an evaluation license][pspdfkit trial], follow the PSPDFKit for Web trial link in the email you received. This will automatically fill in the license information in the following examples on this page.

**How to extend the trial**

Sign up for a trial again using the same email address and you will receive a new key via email.

**Where do you replace your trial key on an existing server?**

The server has an `ACTIVATION_KEY` environment variable. To update the license key to another trial key, you have to wipe the database. For Docker Compose setups, this can be done with `docker-compose down --volumes`.

**Accessing license information — for existing customers**

1.  In your web browser, log in to https://customers.pspdfkit.com and navigate to the Your Licenses & Keys page.

2.  Locate your PSPDFKit for Web license and click Download PSPDFKit for Web to see all the download options.

3.  Open Set Up Server and follow the instructions on that page to set up Docker and the PSPDFKit Server image and run some examples.

4.  Now you’re ready to integrate PSPDFKit for Web into your app’s [frontend][integrating pspdfkit for web] and [backend][managing documents].
