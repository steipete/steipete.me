PSPDFKit for Web supports opening and editing password-protected PDFs. Passwords can be included in the JSON Web Token (JWT), supplied when loading the PDF, or entered by the user when accessing the document.

## Set the Default Document Password

To supply the password when loading a PDF, set the password via the initial `Configuration#password` option:

[==

```es
PSPDFKit.load({
  password: "secr3t",
  ...,
});
```

```js
PSPDFKit.load({
  password: "secr3t",
  ...
});
```

==]

Note that setting this property will make loading PDF documents that are not protected by a password fail. As such, be sure to only add it for documents protected by a password.

## Include the Password in the JWT (Server Only)

To include the password in the JWT used to authenticate clients, add the `password` claim to your JWT:

[==

```es
jwt.sign(
  {
    document_id: document_id,
    password: "secr3t"
    // ...
  },
  fs.readFileSync("./jwt.pem"),
  {
    algorithm: "RS256",
    expiresIn: 10 * 365 * 24 * 60 * 60 // 10 yrs
  }
);
```

```js
jwt.sign(
  {
    document_id: document_id,
    password: "secr3t"
    // ...
  },
  fs.readFileSync("./jwt.pem"),
  {
    algorithm: "RS256",
    expiresIn: 10 * 365 * 24 * 60 * 60 // 10 yrs
  }
);
```

==]

## User Enters the Password

If the password is neither included in the JWT or set via the `Configuration#password` option, the user will be asked to enter the password via a password prompt.
