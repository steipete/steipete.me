Since JavaScript does not ship geometry helpers by default, we at PSPDFKit developed a set of tested geometry classes that we use throughout all our classes. These types are based on the [Immutable.js][] library in order to work with immutable data.

This article should give you a quick overview of the basic data types we expose right now and when you want to use them. Please refer to the [`PSPDFKit.Geometry` documentation][] for an in-depth look at the APIs.

| PSPDFKit&nbsp;Class | Use Case                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [`Point`][]         | Describe a point in 2D space.                                                                                              |
| [`DrawingPoint`][]  | An extension of the point with an intensity value. This is used for storing pressure while drawing an [`InkAnnotation`][]. |
| [`Rect`][]          | Describes a rectangle in space. This is the combination of a location (point) and a dimension (size).                      |
| [`Size`][]          | Describes the size of an element. This is similar to point, but its value should be interpreted as a dimension.            |

All of these classes come with a number of geometric helpers. For a full list, please refer
to the [`PSPDFKit.Geometry` documentation][]:

```es
const { Point } = PSPDFKit.Geometry;

const point = new Point({ x: 10, y: 20 })
  .translateX(20)
  .translateY(40)
  .scale(1.5);

console.log(point); // => Point({ x: 45, y: 90 })
```

```js
var point = new PSPDFKit.Geometry.Point({ x: 10, y: 20 })
  .translateX(20)
  .translateY(40)
  .scale(1.5);

console.log(point); // => Point({ x: 45, y: 90 })
```
