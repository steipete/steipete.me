title: Annotation Author Name
section: developers

---

Starting with PSPDFKit for Web 2018.2, the author of an annotation will be saved under the `creatorName` property of an annotation. By default, the `creatorName` for all newly created annotations is set to `null`.

The `creatorName` can be set by the [`Instance#setAnnotationCreatorName`] function:

```js
instance.setAnnotationCreatorName("Alice");
```
