[TypeScript][] is a language created by Microsoft that brings typing to JavaScript.

To integrate regular JavaScript into a TypeScript application, you have to add a type definition. Getting starting with this is very easy, and Microsoft wrote [an excellent guide on this topic][microsoft guide].

To make it even easier to integrate PSPDFKit for Web into your TypeScript application, weâ€™re also working on providing a feature-complete TypeScript definition in a future release.
