PSPDFKit for Web also supports Internet Explorer 11. Since this browser does not support ES2015, this guide covers some caveats for adding full Internet Explorer 11 support.

## PSPDFKit for Web Standalone Caveats

The Standalone version of PSPDFKit for Web requires a large amount of memory and can trigger out of memory issues on IE 11, as memory management in that browser is unreliable. Closing/reopening the tab is a workaround; however, if support for IE 11 is important to you, we suggest using the Server-backed version of PSPDFKit for Web.

## Don’t Rely on Arrow Functions

[Arrow functions][mozilla guide arrow functions] are a relatively new addition to the JavaScript language. Please make sure you don’t use arrow functions in your PSPDFKit integration code without transpiling them to proper ES5.

Consider the following example:

[==

```es
PSPDFKit.load(configuration)
  .then(instance => {
    instance.setViewState(viewState => viewState.set("currentPageIndex", 1));
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error(error.message);
  });
```

This should be written with non-arrow functions, like this:

```js
PSPDFKit.load(configuration)
  .then(function(instance) {
    instance.setViewState(function(viewState) {
      return viewState.set("currentPageIndex", 1);
    });
  })
  .catch(function(error) {
    console.error(error.message);
  });
```

==]

Be aware that single-line arrow functions (without curly braces) return the value of their expression. This means that it might be necessary to add a `return` as well (as you can see with the callback of [`Instance#setViewState`][] in our example above).

## Customizing the Appearance

PSPDFKit for Web comes with support for selecting your [theme][], but it is not available in IE 11 due to its lack of support for [CSS custom properties][mozilla guide css custom properties], which are needed for our themes feature. However, you can add your own custom stylesheets, as explained in our [CSS Customization][] guide.
