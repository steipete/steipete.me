# Q: Is there a way to force PSPDFKit to use the Web version and not the Electron version when loading?

A: It is possible to inject some code that monkey-patches `navigator.userAgent` to not include `Electron/` in the string.

Here's an example that uses the current Chrome User Agent. 

```javascript
const chromeUserAgent =
  "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_14_5) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/76.0.3809.100 Safari/537.36";
Object.defineProperty(navigator, "userAgent", { get: () => chromeUserAgent });
```

This has been tested with PSPDFKit for Web 2019.4.1
