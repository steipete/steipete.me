title: How to default to using a Cloudy Border
section: knowledge-base
---

## Question: How can I configure my rectangles and ellipses to default to a cloudy border?

## Answer:

You can set the corresponding annotation preset to have a `cloudyBorderIntensity` value greater than `0`.

Generally, there's no applicable value range for a cloudy border intensity (no upper limit) as it would vary with the stroke width and the size of the annotation.

Depending on your use case, it may be enough to stick to a presumably safe value between `0` and `5` for example or even safer between `0` and `3`. For reference the default value used in the annotation toolbar is `2`.

You could set it in the annotation presets like this, for example:

```js
const annotationPresets = PSPDFKit.defaultAnnotationPresets;
annotationPresets.rectangle = {
  ...annotationPresets.rectangle,
  cloudyBorderIntensity: 4
};
return PSPDFKit.load({ ...defaultConfiguration, annotationPresets }).then(
  instance => {
    console.log("PSPDFKit for Web successfully loaded!!", instance);

    return instance;
  }
);
```

## Question 2:

Is it mandatory to update the inset rectangle as you show them? For example, if you want to do is preselect the cloudy border when a user selects the rectangle tool - the programmatic equivalent of the user picking the cloudy border option from the dropdown after selecting the rectangle tool. Is there a way to do just that?

## Answer:

Yes! Then you just need to use the default cloudy border intensity for the UI, which is `2`, and the rest of the code gets much simpler:

```js
const annotationPresets = PSPDFKit.defaultAnnotationPresets;
annotationPresets.rectangle = {
  cloudyBorderIntensity: 2
};
PSPDFKit.load({ ...defaultConfiguration, annotationPresets }).then(
  instance => instance
);
```
