## Q: How do I prevent `page.press` event from firing when the user clicks on a custom overlay?

A: By default, when we click on a custom overlay, `page.press` event also gets fired. There might be cases when you don't want to do that.

`page.press` internally uses the browser's `onpointerup` event. So in order to prevent that event from firing, we will have to stop the propagation of the same event (`onpointerup`) from the custom overlay.

So we recommend that you use the `onpointerup` event on the custom overlay instead of the `onclick` event:

```js
PSPDFKit.load(options).then(instance => {
    const div = document.createElement("div");
    div.className = "overlay" // give some height and width to the div so that it's practically clickable.

    div.onpointerup = e => {
        // We need to call `e.stopPropogation()` stop the propagation of the onpointerup event and `page.press` event won't get fired.
        e.stopPropagation();

        // do what you wanted to do on click.
    }

    const item = new PSPDFKit.CustomOverlayItem({
      id: "id",
      node: div,
      pageIndex: 0,
      position: new PSPDFKit.Geometry.Point({ x: 50, y: 600 })
    });

    instance.setCustomOverlayItem(item);
})
```

This has been tested with PSPDFKit for Web 2019.5.4
