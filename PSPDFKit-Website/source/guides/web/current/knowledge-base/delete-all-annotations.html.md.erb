title: Delete all annotations

## Q: We want to delete all annotations in the document at once.

A: There's no specific command to delete all annotations, or multiple annotations. However, it can be easily achieved by iterating the pages, retrieving all its annotations an calling [`PSPDFKit.Instance.deleteAnnotation()`] on each of their `id`s:

```js
PSPDFKit.load(configuration).then(instance => {
  (async () => {
    const pagesAnnotations = await Promise.all(
      Array.from({ length: instance.totalPageCount }).map((_, pageIndex) =>
        instance.getAnnotations(pageIndex)
      )
    );
    await Promise.all(
      pagesAnnotations.flatMap(pageAnnotations =>
        pageAnnotations.map(annotation =>
          instance.deleteAnnotation(annotation.id)
        )
      )
    );
  })();
});
```

This has been tested with PSPDFKit for Web 2019.3.1
