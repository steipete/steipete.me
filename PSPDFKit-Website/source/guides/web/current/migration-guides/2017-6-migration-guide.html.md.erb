[PSPDFKit for Web 2017.6][] adds support for note annotations, with full cross‑platform support alongside real-time collaboration via PSPDFKit Instant. More specifically:

- [`ViewState#viewMode`][] is deprecated in favor of the newly added [`ViewState#viewMode`][] and [`ViewState#scrollMode`][] options, and will be removed in version 2017.7.
- [`ViewState#pageSpacing`][] is now used to determine the spacing between pages when in double-page mode. The default value has therefore been changed to zero. For the previous behavior, please use [`ViewState#spreadSpacing`][] instead.
- Zoom modes have been renamed to better reflect their behavior in regard to spreads. The deprecated options will be removed in version 2017.7.
  - Instead of [`ZoomMode.PAGE_FIT`][], use [`ZoomMode.FIT_TO_VIEWPORT`][].
  - Instead of [`ZoomMode.PAGE_WIDTH`][], use [`ZoomMode.FIT_TO_WIDTH`][].

With this release, we also added support for deleting imported documents from PSPDFKit Server’s database. See our [API documentation][] for further information.
