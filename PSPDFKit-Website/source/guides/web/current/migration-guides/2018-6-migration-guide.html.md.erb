[PSPDFKit for Web 2018.6][] adds stamp annotations, a new sidebar mode to display and manage document bookmarks, and a number of hot fixes and improvements. Please refer to the [changelog][] for detailed information.

If youâ€™re maintaining a Server installation, be sure to check out the [2018.6 Server Migration Guide][].

### Notable Changes

- Adds two toolbar items to [`PSPDFKit.defaultToolbarItems`][defaulttoolbaritems]:
  - `sidebar-bookmarks` for the bookmarks sidebar. It is part of the `sidebar` `dropdownGroup`.
  - `stamp` for stamp annotations.
- The `stamp` and `image` toolbar items are now grouped in a `dropdownGroup` called `image`.
- `dropdownGroup`s with only one item are now rendered as flat buttons instead of dropdowns.
- Prior to this release, custom toolbar item icons with data URIs appeared shifted to the left. This is now fixed, and previous workarounds to this issue are no longer needed. But just in case you need additional CSS rules to style custom toolbar icons, you can use the `.PSPDFKit-Toolbar-Button-Icon` CSS selector.
- API: Changes annotation APIs to not throw synchronously but rather reject with an error instead.
