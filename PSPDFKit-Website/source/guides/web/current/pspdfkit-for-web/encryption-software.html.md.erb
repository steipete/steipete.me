PSPDFKit for Web uses different encryption software to enable the full potential of the PDF spec and to verify our license keys work as intended. When using our [server-backed][] deployment options, additional software is used to allow PSPDFKit Server to connect to SSL/TLS URLs.

### Standalone and Server Backed

Regardless of the chosen deployment option, all versions of PSPDFKit will use the following software:

- [Botan][] — Decrypts and validates license keys, in addition to enabling extended PDF features such as digital signatures.
- [PDFium][] — Decrypts password-protected PDFs.

### PSPDFKit Server

In addition to the software listed above, our server component includes additional software:

- [OpenSSL][] — Connects to remote SSL/TLS URLs and verifies the JSON Web Token (JWT) signature.
