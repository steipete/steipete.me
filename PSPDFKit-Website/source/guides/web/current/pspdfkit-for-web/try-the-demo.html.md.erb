Thank you for trying PSPDFKit for Web.

PSPDFKit for Web comes with two deployment options out of the box: server-backed and standalone. Based on the chosen deployment path, different setup steps need to be taken.

## Server-Backed Deployment

This setup offers performant rendering and enables archiving on S3, along with collaboration in your browser with [PSPDFKit Instant][].

- [Setting Up PSPDFKit Server][]
- [Integration][server-backed integration]

## Standalone Deployment

This setup is exclusively on the client side and allows you to work in contexts where no server is available.

- [Adding to Your Project][]
- [Integration][standalone integration]
