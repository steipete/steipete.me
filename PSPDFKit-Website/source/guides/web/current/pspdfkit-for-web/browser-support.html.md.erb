PSPDFKit for Web (both the server-backed and standalone deployment options \*) supports all commonly used browsers in their latest versions.

## Desktop

- Google Chrome
- Mozilla Firefox
- Apple Safari
- Microsoft Edge
- [Microsoft Internet Explorer 11][]

\* Standalone deployment renders PDF documents in the client browser, so rendering performance will depend on the host machine.

### Long-Term Support

The only browser vendor currently supporting an LTS (Long Term Service) / ESR (Extended Support Release) version is Mozilla Firefox. See [Firefox Extended Support Release][] for details.

We support versions 52, 60, and 68 (current) of Firefox ESR.

Google offers [Chrome Browser for enterprise][] to help with managing browser deployment and updates.

All browsers without a long-term service release require regular updates to new versions to fix security vulnerabilities.

Note that some LTS versions of Windows 10 [ship without Microsoft Edge][]. We still support Microsoft Internet Explorer 11 for such systems, along with older Windows variants.

## Mobile

- Chrome on Android
- Safari on iOS

As all of these browsers auto update, we test with the latest stable release. PSPDFKit for Web generally still works, even if you’re a few versions behind, as we are careful in adopting the latest web features for essential functionality and use polyfills for missing functionality.

## Polyfills

PSPDFKit for Web includes the following [polyfills][] to enable next-generation features on our target platforms:

- A [custom regenerator runtime][]
- [core-js][]’ polyfills
- [Fetch][], which provides the polyfillable parts of the [WHATWG fetch spec][]

## WebAssembly

The standalone version of PSPDFKit for Web uses WebAssembly to render documents. Please see our [Real-World WebAssembly Benchmark][] to test the performance of your browser and OS, or learn more in the [Performance][] guide.
