The PSPDFKit .NET Library is built to support [.NET Standard][dot-net-standard] 2.0. Building the library against .NET standard allows support for many .NET variants (.NET Core, .NET Framework, Mono, and more). For a support list and versions, please see Microsoftâ€™s [.NET implementation support][dot-net-implementation-support].

#### Brief Supported List

- .NET Core 2.0
- .NET Framework 4.6.1
- Mono 5.4

In order to take advantage of the already proven C++ PSPDFKit Core, the library has a native element to it. Because there is a native element, there are strict operating system support requirements.

## Windows

The native library has been compiled under Windows 10 and will support all Microsoft supported versions of Windows 10 (version 1703+). Currently, the architectures supported are `i386` and `x64`. For more information on Windows release support, please consult the [Windows lifecycle fact sheet][windows-lifecycle-fact-sheet].

## Linux

We have compiled the native library to support most major Linux distributions. There is a requirement of at least Glibc 2.19, which ensures compatibility with most major long-term support and other newer distributions. Currently, the architecture supported is `x64`.

## macOS

The macOS native binary has been compiled with and will only support Catalina 10.15+.
