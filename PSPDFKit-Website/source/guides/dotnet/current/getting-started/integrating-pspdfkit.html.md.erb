title: Integrating PSPDFKit
section: developers

order: 1

The PSPDFKit .NET Library was built to work with a wide variety of .NET frameworks. So whether you’re using the latest version of Windows or developing a cross-platform app for Linux and macOS, we have solutions.

Currently there is a fair amount of fragmentation across the .NET ecosystem, but hopefully we will see this resolved with the introduction of [.NET 5][dotnet-5].

For now, we’ve decided to ship PSPDFKit for .NET built against .NET Standard 2.0, which ensures compatibility across many environments. Check out the [.NET Standard][dotnet-standard] guide and our [Version Support][version-support] guide to find out more about compatibilities.
