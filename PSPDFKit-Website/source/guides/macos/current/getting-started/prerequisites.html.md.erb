PSPDFKit is a commercial product and uses a license key to verify your copy against the package name you registered. If you donâ€™t have a license yet, request an evaluation license [here][pspdfkit trial] and follow the instructions in the email you receive.

PSPDFKit requires the latest stable version of Xcode available at the time of the release. This is a hard requirement; please make sure you have the correct version of Xcode installed.
