The simplest way to integrate PSPDFKit is to [use CocoaPods][]. If
you prefer or require a manual setup, please follow the steps below.

Log in to the [PSPDFKit Customer Portal][] and
download the latest version of the PSPDFKit for macOS framework. You should now
have `PSPDFKit-macOS.dmg` on your file system.

1.  Open `PSPDFKit-macOS.dmg`.
2.  Add `PSPDFKit.framework` to your Xcode project.
3.  Drag `PSPDFKit.framework` to Embedded Binaries (in the General tab of your target).
4.  Build and run.

## Integrating with Tests

If you need to integrate PSPDFKit into your test targets, just add
`PSPDFKit.framework` to the Link Binaries With Libraries build phase (in the
Build Phases tab of your test target).
