## Quick Start

PSPDFKit is a PDF mobile SDK for iOS, macOS, Android, Windows, and Web that deals with everything related to PDF. Itâ€™s a large framework, and we expose a lot of API, so many aspects can be customized. The API can be intimidating at first, but you really only need the basics to [get started][Integrating PSPDFKit macOS].

[PSPDFKit for macOS][] is based on the exact same core that powers our iOS framework, sans views.

> **Note:** In addition to reading the macOS guides, we encourage you to take a look at our [iOS guides][iOS Guides], most of which apply to the macOS version as is.
