Developers can use [Xamarin][] to write native iOS, Android, and macOS apps with a shared C# codebase. We provide separate bindings for iOS and Android, as they are different SDKs and have an API that closely matches the underlying system.

## PSPDFKit for macOS

PSPDFKit for macOS includes full-featured [bindings for Xamarin/Visual Studio][xamarin-ios]. We work closely with Xamarin to provide up-to-date bindings shortly after the regular PSPDFKit releases. These bindings allow extensive customization and subclassing.

You can try the demo by first requesting it from [our website][pspdfkit trial] and then adding the PSPDFKit binary to the Xamarin binding.

## Building PSPDFKit.Mac.dll

In order to build this binding project, you need the following:

- Visual Studio for Mac
- Xamarin.Mac 6.x +

### Step 1 — Get the Bindings

1.  Clone the [`PSPDFKit/Xamarin-iOS`][] repository from GitHub.
2.  Open the `Xamarin-iOS` directory.

### Step 2 — Copy the Required Files

1.  Download PSPDFKit for macOS from the [Customer Portal][] if you haven’t done so already.
2.  Alternatively, request a [trial version][pspdfkit trial] if you’re not yet a customer.
3.  Open the DMG file you downloaded above and copy `PSPDFKit.framework` into the `PSPDFKit.Mac` folder.

### Step 3 — Get the DLL

You have two options to get the DLL.

#### Using Visual Studio for Mac

1.  Open `PSPDFKit.sln`, which is located in the root folder.
2.  Build the `macOS` project inside the solution.
3.  Get the DLL from the `bin` folder of `PSPDFKit.Mac`.

#### Using the Command Line / Terminal

We use [Cake][] as our build system.

1.  Run the `./build.sh --target mac` (macOS) command from the `root` directory.
2.  The resulting DLL will be inside the root folder.

### Step 4 — Integrate into Your Project

1.  Add a reference of `PSPDFKit.Mac.dll` to your project.
2.  Add the following namespace to your project:

```csharp
using PSPDFKit.Core;
```

#### Set the License Key

Call `PSPDFKitGlobal.SetLicenseKey("YOUR_LICENSE_KEY_GOES_HERE");` early on in your app delegate before accessing any other PSPDFKit classes.
