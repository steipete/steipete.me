This guide walks you through how to update from PSPDFKit 2.0–2.7 to PSPDFKit 3.

PSPDFKit 3 for macOS fully supports macOS 10.12, 10.13, and 10.14. Learn more in our [Version Support guide][]. Xcode 10 is required, as support for Xcode 9 has been dropped.

PSPDFKit for macOS shares the codebase with iOS, so be sure to study the [iOS Migration Guide][] for the full list of every breaking API change, along with its suggested migration strategy.
