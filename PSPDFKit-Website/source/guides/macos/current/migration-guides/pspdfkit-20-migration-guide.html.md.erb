This guide walks you through how to update from PSPDFKit 1.0–1.2 to PSPDFKit 2.

PSPDFKit 2 for macOS fully supports macOS 10.12 and 10.13. Learn more in our [Version Support guide][]. Xcode 9 is required, as support for Xcode 8 has been dropped.

PSPDFKit for macOS shares the codebase with iOS, so be sure to study the [iOS Migration Guide][] for the full list of every breaking API change, along with its suggested migration strategy.
