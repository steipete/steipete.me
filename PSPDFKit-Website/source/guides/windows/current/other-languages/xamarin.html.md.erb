PSPDFKit for Windows UWP includes full-featured [bindings for Xamarin][xamarin-uwp]. We work closely with Xamarin to provide up-to-date bindings shortly after our regular PSPDFKit releases.

## Using PSPDFKit for Windows in Your Xamarin.Forms UWP Project

To use PSPDFKit for Windows in your Xamarin.Forms UWP project, you first need to follow the [PSPDFKit for Windows integration guide][]. Then you can create a Xamarin.Forms control that inherits from [`Xamarin.Forms.View`][]. This can be used to host the actual [`PdfView`][] using a Xamarin.Forms custom renderer technique. We encourage you to read the Xamarin.Forms documentation — specifically the [Implementing a View][] article — as we use this pattern in our example project.

### Xamarin.Forms Custom Control

- [`PdfViewer.cs`][]: This is the Xamarin.Forms custom control that is used to represent a [`PdfView`][] in the Xamarin.Forms context. In this particular example, it mirrors properties that are bindable from a XAML context.
- [`PdfViewerRenderer.cs`][]: This is the class that will actually contain the [`PdfView`][] object initialization and implementation. `PdfViewerRenderer.cs` is hosted in the UWP project context, so it has access to all UWP platform features. The [Creating the Custom Renderer on UWP][] document goes into greater detail on this subject.

Now that you have both pieces in place, you can use [`PdfViewer.cs`][] from the Xamarin.Forms XAML context like this:

```xaml
<ContentPage.Content>
	<PdfViewer
		License="{StaticResource PSPDFKitLicense}"
		PdfUriSource="ms-appx:///Assets/pdfs/default.pdf"/>
</ContentPage.Content>
```

> **ℹ️  Note:** [`PdfViewer.cs`][] and [`PdfViewerRenderer.cs`][] are just provided as a way to render a PDF within a Xamarin.Forms UWP application. You can achieve the same result by creating a UWP page to host the [`PdfView`][] and your own UWP logic and by using a `Xamarin.Forms.ContentPage` as a container of said UWP page. This is also demonstrated in the [`PrintPageContainer.cs`][], [`PrintPageRenderer.cs`][], [`PrintPage.xaml.cs`][], and [`PrintPage.xaml`][] samples.

## Example Project

We have a [great example project called `XamarinPDF`][xamarin.forms uwp example project]. It shows how to build an app with PSPDFKit for Windows UWP using Xamarin.Forms. To run this example, simply follow the steps provided in the [Xamarin-UWP repo README][].
