title: Suspending Unloading
section: developers
---

You may want to perform some operation such as saving while the [`PdfView`][pdfview] is unloading. However, `Unloaded` events are fired too late to interact with the `PdfView`. What you can do is suspend unloading until you are finished performing any required operations. To achieve this, add an event handler for [`PdfView.OnOnSuspendUnloading`][onsuspend].

Note that it is very important to finally call `Deferral.Complete()` or the unloading will be blocked:

```csharp
{
    // Subscribe to the event handler.
    PdfView.OnSuspendUnloading += PdfViewOnOnSuspendUnloading;
}

private async void PDFView_OnOnSuspendUnloading(PdfView sender, Deferral deferral)
{
    try
    {
        // Save our PDF to a new file.
        var savePicker = new FileSavePicker {SuggestedStartLocation = PickerLocationId.DocumentsLibrary};
        savePicker.FileTypeChoices.Add("Portable Document Format", new List<string> {".pdf"});
        savePicker.SuggestedFileName = "New Document";

        var file = await savePicker.PickSaveFileAsync();
        if (file != null)
        {
            using (var stream = await file.OpenAsync(FileAccessMode.ReadWrite))
            using (var dataWriter = new DataWriter(stream))
            {
                await PDFView.Document.ExportToDataWriterAsync(dataWriter);
            }
        }
    }
    finally
    {
        deferral.Complete();
    }
}
```
