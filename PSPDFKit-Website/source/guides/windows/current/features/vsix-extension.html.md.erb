title: Using the Visual Studio Extension

The recommended way of adding the PSPDFKit SDK to your project is to use the PSPDFKit for Windows [NuGet package][nuget-guide] provided in the SDK zip file. However, some customers prefer to use a Visual Studio Extension (VSIX). We provide PSPDFKit for Windows as a VSIX in the SDK zip file. You can install this systemwide and then add a reference to your project.

Please be aware that with VSIX, you can only have one version of the SDK installed at a time.

## Installing the VSIX

After making sure Visual Studio is closed, double-click on the installer, `PSPDFKit for Windows.vsix`. The installer will guide you through the installation process.

## Adding PSPDFKit to Your App

In the Solution Explorer, right-click on References for your project and then select Add Reference.

Navigate to Universal Windows > Extensions, and then select both PSPDFKit for UWP and Visual C++ 2015 Runtime for Universal Windows Platform Apps.

Click on OK and you should see the following in your references.
