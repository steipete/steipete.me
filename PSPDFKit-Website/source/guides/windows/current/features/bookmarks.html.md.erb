When you want to remember a certain page in your document, the easiest way to do this is to add a bookmark.

The current list of bookmarks can be retrieved with [`GetBookmarksAsync`][getbookmarksasync]:

```csharp
var bookmarks = await pdfView.Document.GetBookmarksAsync();
```

You can create a bookmark with a name and an [`Action`][actions] and add it to a page like this:

```csharp
var createdBookmark = await pdfView.Document.CreateBookmarkAsync(new Bookmark("Page 3", new GoTo(2)));
```

In the above code, you created a bookmark with the name Page 3, which will be displayed in the bookmarks sidebar, and a [`GoTo`][goto] action so that the currently displayed page is changed to the provided page index when the bookmark is clicked on.

The returned `Bookmark` object has a property `Id` which is used to identify the bookmark when updating or removing it. For example, using the returned bookmark above, you can update it like this:

```csharp
createdBookmark.Name = "Page 2";
createdBookmark.Action = new GoTo(1);
await pdfView.Document.UpdateBookmarkAsync(createdBookmark);
```

Or you can remove it like this:

```csharp
await pdfView.Document.DeleteBookmarkAsync(createdBookmark.Id);
```

You can also create a bookmark from [Instant JSON][instant json]:

```js
{
  "id": "this is ignored",
  "name": "My bookmark",
  "action": {
    "type": "goTo",
    "pageIndex": 2
  }
}
```

```csharp
var bookmarkJson = LoadJsonObjectAsync("bookmark.json");
var createdBookmark = await pdfView.Document.CreateBookmarkAsync(Bookmark.FromJson(bookmarkJson));
```
