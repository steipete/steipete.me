title: How to Perform a Task When PdfView is Loaded
section: developers
---

Sometimes you might want to perform a task after the SDK is loaded. This can be easily done with [`PdfView`][] events.

In [`PdfView`][], there is an event, `InitializationCompletedHandler`, which is fired when the [`PdfView`][] is ready to receive commands. You can subscribe to this event, and afterward, you can perform any task you need:

```csharp
public OpenFileProgramatically()
{
    InitializeComponent();
    PDFView.InitializationCompletedHandler += PdfView_InitializationCompletedHandler;
}
private async void PdfView_InitializationCompletedHandler(PdfView sender, Document document)
{
    try
    {
        var file = await StorageFile.GetFileFromApplicationUriAsync(new Uri("ms-appx:///Assets/pdfs/default.pdf"));
        if (file == null) return;
        await sender.OpenStorageFileAsync(file);
    }
    catch (Exception e)
    {
        var messageDialog = new MessageDialog(e.Message);
        await messageDialog.ShowAsync();
    }
}
```

The example above shows how to change the document shown in the [`PdfView`][] when [`PdfView`][] is loaded.
