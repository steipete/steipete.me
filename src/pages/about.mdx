    <p>Currently, I'm vibe coding <a href="https://codelooper.app">my next project</a>, exploring new technologies and opportunities in the web development ecosystem.</p>
    <p>After years in the native iOS space, I'm excited to be learning and building with modern web technologies.</p>
    <p>I share my time between Vienna and London.</p>

I have the luxury of deciding what to build, and I don't need to make money. So everything I'm making is gonna be open source. Read more about my journey in [Finding My Spark Again](/posts/2025/finding-my-spark-again/).

I'm looking for new opportunities to share my learnings at conferences. [Check out my speaking history and topics](https://github.com/steipete/speaking).
