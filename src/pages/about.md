    <p>Currently, I'm vibe coding my next project, exploring new technologies and opportunities in the web development ecosystem.</p>
    <p>After years in the native iOS space, I'm excited to be learning and building with modern web technologies.</p>
    <p>I share my time between Vienna and London.</p>
    <p>I have the luxury of deciding what to build, and I don't need to make money. So everything I'm making is gonna be open source. Read more about my journey in <a href="/posts/2025/finding-my-spark-again/">Finding My Spark Again</a>.</p>
