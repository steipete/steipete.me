It’s been roughly five years since my last post on [petersteinberger.com](http://petersteinberger.com). A lot has changed since then. The last few years I’ve been fully focusing on [PSPDFKit](https://pspdfkit.com) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/steipete). But there are some stories that are better said in a post — Twitter is a stream and can be difficult to follow. 

On this blog, you can expect some of my highlights, rants, and tech mumblings — basically anything that doesn’t fit on a corporate blog. There are some good stories waiting to be told, so I hope you’ll follow along.
