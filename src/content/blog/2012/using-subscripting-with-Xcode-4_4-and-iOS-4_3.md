title: "Using Subscripting With Xcode 4.4 And iOS 4.3+"

description: "Get a head start on using Objective-C's modern subscripting syntax in your iOS apps before Apple officially introduces it. I share a clever header-only hack that lets you use the elegant array[index] and dictionary[key] notation with Xcode 4.4 while maintaining backward compatibility with iOS 4.3+. Discover how this temporary shim works behind the scenes with ARCLite, and why you can safely adopt this cleaner syntax in your codebase today."

Now that Xcode 4.4 has finally reached Golden Master and [you can submit apps](https://devforums.apple.com/message/694250#694250), here's a trick to use [subscripting](http://clang.llvm.org/docs/ObjectiveCLiterals.html) *right now*. Yes, Apple will introduce this feature in a future version of OS X and iOS, but why wait? Here's the snippet from [PSPDFKit, my iOS PDF framework](http://pspdfkit.com), to make it work:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/3090279.js"> </script>

It's a bit crude, and Xcode won't show any warnings if you're doing subscripting on *any* object now, but you know what you're doing, right? Furthermore this is only *temporary*, to make it compile with Xcode 4.4. In Xcode 4.5, this snippet won't do anything and isn't needed anymore, since the new SDK already has those methods defined on the classes you care about. Just make sure this is in your global header file (e.g. precompiled headers).

Note that unlike literals, which are really just *syntactical sugar* and already work great in Xcode 4.4+ (LLVM 4.0+), subscripting actually calls into new methods. So how does this "magically defining headers" actually work?

Thanks to [Mike Ash](http://www.mikeash.com/pyblog/friday-qa-2012-06-22-objective-c-literals.html) and [CÃ©dric Luthi](http://twitter.com/0xced), here's the answer:

> The subscripting compatibility shim is actually part of ARCLite. The __ARCLite__ load function takes care of dynamically adding the four subscript methods with class_addMethod. The implementations of these methods simply call the equivalent non-subscript methods.

If you, for [*any* reason](http://www.learn-cocos2d.com/2012/06/mythbusting-8-reasons-arc/), are not on ARC yet, you really want to force the compiler to link with libarclite using the ```-fobjc-arc``` linker flag. This works all the way back to iOS 4.3.
