description: "This post marks the reboot of my blog where I plan to share iOS development insights and personal thoughts. After feedback about my frequent tweeting, I'm creating a space for longer-form content beyond Twitter's character limits. The previous blog content has been archived as it would have required significant updates."

I've rebooted my blog. I will add random bits about iOS development and some personal thoughts, especially since some of my friends complained that apparently [I tweet too much](http://twitter.com/amyhoy/status/185733715874422784) (*cough* Amy *cough*)
And they're right. [I love Twitter](http://favstar.fm/users/steipete), but sometimes you just need more than 140 characters.

The old content has been moved into [limbo](http://inception-explained.com/). Most of it would have needed some update to be valid again, so you're not missing a lot. That said, if you're coming from Google and miss a particular thing, hit me up on Twitter and I might dig it up for you.
