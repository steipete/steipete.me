I've been working heavily with AI for the past few months, and many times when I post something on Twitter, the replies are predictable: "Oh my god, how much did you pay for that?"

The thing is, people don't understand that you don't actually have to pay *that* much to get incredible AI productivity. Here's the real math.

## The Current Best Deal: Claude Max at $200/month

**[Claude Max](https://claude.ai/settings/billing) gives you almost unlimited use of [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)**, which is hands-down the best terminal-based AI tool available (next to Cursor). For $200/month, you get 20× the usage of Claude Pro.

The Claude Max subscription uses Opus as the default model. When you go below 50% of your allowance, it will downgrade you to use Sonnet. With the 20× higher limits, this downgrade rarely happens in practice.

For someone doing serious [vibe coding](/posts/2025/the-future-of-vibe-coding/), $200/month is a steal.

## Cursor: The Math That Makes Sense

**Cursor Pro costs $20/month** and gives you 500 "fast" requests plus unlimited "slow" requests. Beyond that, it's **$0.04 per standard request**.

That workshop I did? Probably 200+ AI requests across 3 hours. Let's do the math: 200 requests × $0.04 = **$8**. 

For an afternoon of intensive coding with AI assistance, you're looking at pocket change. Even if you burn through 1,000 requests in a month, that's $40 on top of your $20 subscription.

Enabling max mode is far more expensive and can be useful for larger projects, but it's not a requirement to be really effective working with AI.

## The Thing That Actually Gets Expensive: OpenAI's o3

Here's where I'll be honest: **about half my monthly AI bill goes to o3**. 

OpenAI's o3 model costs **$10 per 1M input tokens and $40 per 1M output tokens**. When you're debugging complex code and you want the absolute best reasoning, o3 delivers—but it adds up fast.

I spent around $400 on o3 last month because I was working more efficiently. When I hit truly difficult problems, throwing o3 at them for a few hours beats banging my head against the wall for days.

## Budget Alternative: Repo Prompt for o3 Access

If you're tight on money but still want o3's reasoning power, I highly recommend [Repo Prompt](https://repoprompt.com/). It lets you use o3 through your ChatGPT subscription instead of paying API rates.

While it's more manual than integrated tools, it's incredibly effective at taking code changes and applying them to your project. The workflow is straightforward: export your repo context, get o3's analysis and suggestions, then apply the changes back to your codebase.

It's an amazing tool that bridges the gap between premium AI access and budget constraints. Definitely worth experimenting with.

## The Contractor Math

Let's be conservative and say **$800/day** (though I'd assume many of you charge more). The AI subscription math is a no-brainer.

One afternoon saved per month = $200 in billable time. Claude Max pays for itself in 5 saved hours. Cursor pays for itself in 45 minutes.

The productivity multiplier is so absurd that arguing about the cost is like complaining about the price of coffee while billing $200/hour.

## TL;DR

Time is the only non-refillable resource. Claude Max at $200 is currently the cheapest way I know to mint extra hours—and those hours compound faster than any SaaS line item ever will.
