I've been working heavily with AI for the past two months, and every time I post something on Twitter, the replies are predictable: "Oh my god, how much did you pay for that?"

The thing is, people don't understand that you don't actually have to pay *that* much to get incredible AI productivity. Here's the real math.

## The Current Best Deal: Claude Max at $200/month

**Claude Max gives you almost unlimited use of Claude Code**, which is hands-down the best terminal-based AI tool available (next to Cursor). For $200/month, you get 20× the usage of Claude Pro.

When you hit limits on the cheaper Claude Pro ($20/month), it doesn't downgrade you to a weaker model—you just hit rate limits and wait for the 5-hour reset. With Max, that practically never happens.

For someone doing serious [vibe coding](/posts/2025/the-future-of-vibe-coding/), $200/month is a steal. That workshop I did? Probably 200+ AI requests across 3 hours. On Claude Pro, I'd have been rate-limited after the first hour.

## Cursor: The Math That Makes Sense

**Cursor Pro costs $20/month** and gives you 500 "fast" requests plus unlimited "slow" requests. Beyond that, it's **$0.04 per standard request**.

Let's do the math: 200 requests × $0.04 = **$8**. 

For an afternoon of intensive coding with AI assistance, you're looking at pocket change. Even if you burn through 1,000 requests in a month, that's $40 on top of your $20 subscription.

The real kicker? Premium models like Claude 4 cost more ($0.30 per request), but when you're stuck on a gnarly bug, paying $0.30 to unstick yourself is absurd value.

## The Thing That Actually Gets Expensive: OpenAI's o3

Here's where I'll be honest: **about half my monthly AI bill goes to o3**. 

OpenAI's o3 model costs **$10 per 1M input tokens and $40 per 1M output tokens**. When you're debugging complex code and you want the absolute best reasoning, o3 delivers—but it adds up fast.

I spent around $400 on o3 last month because I was working more efficiently. When I hit truly difficult problems, throwing o3 at them for a few hours beats banging my head against the wall for days.

## Budget Alternative: Repo Prompt for o3 Access

If you're tight on money but still want o3's reasoning power, I highly recommend [Repo Prompt](https://repoprompt.com/). It lets you use o3 through your ChatGPT subscription instead of paying API rates.

While it's more manual than integrated tools, it's incredibly effective at taking code changes and applying them to your project. The workflow is straightforward: export your repo context, get o3's analysis and suggestions, then apply the changes back to your codebase.

It's an amazing tool that bridges the gap between premium AI access and budget constraints. Definitely worth experimenting with.

## The Contractor Math

If you value your time at even **$2,000/day** (reasonable for experienced developers), the AI subscription math is a no-brainer.

One afternoon saved per month = $250 in billable time. Claude Max pays for itself in 4 saved hours. Cursor pays for itself in 30 minutes.

The productivity multiplier is so absurd that arguing about the cost is like complaining about the price of coffee while billing $200/hour.

## Other Tools Worth the Money

**Cursor IDE** ($20/month) – Live AI pair programming. It's like having a junior developer who never gets tired and knows every framework.

**Claude Code** (via Max subscription) – The terminal AI that actually understands your codebase context and can make complex changes without breaking everything.

**Rewind** – Screen recording AI that lets you ask "what error message did I see 20 minutes ago?" Perfect for those moments when Claude asks for details you didn't capture.

## TL;DR

Time is the only non-refillable resource. Claude Max at $200 is currently the cheapest way I know to mint extra hours—and those hours compound faster than any SaaS line item ever will.
