`UITextView` on iOS 7 is [a lot more powerful](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UITextView_Class/Reference/UITextView.html#//apple_ref/occ/instp/UITextView/linkTextAttributes), since Apple switched over from using [WebKit](http://www.cocoanetics.com/2012/12/uitextview-caught-with-trousers-down/) to [TextKit](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/StringsTextFonts/Conceptual/TextAndWebiPhoneOS/CustomTextProcessing/CustomTextProcessing.html) for rendering. It's also very much a 1.0, and has some [rather terrible](http://inessential.com/2014/01/07/uitextview_scroll-to-typing_bug) [bugs](https://devforums.apple.com/message/918284#918284). In fact, they go so far that people started writing [replacements for the whole scrolling logic](https://github.com/jaredsinclair/JTSTextView).

Of course, people reported these issues in [PSPDFKit](http://pspdfkit.com) as well, so I had to find a workaround. I'm using `contentInset` when the keyboard (iPhone) or another view (iPhone/iPad) goes up, which is pretty much completely ignored by `UITextView` in iOS 7. This is frustrating mainly because it works perfectly in iOS 6.

At first, my solution was based on a category, but after discovering more and more needed hooks, I moved over to a subclass that [automatically forwards all delegate methods](https://github.com/steipete/PSPDFTextView/blob/ee9ce04ad04217efe0bc84d67f3895a34252d37c/PSPDFTextView/PSPDFTextView.m#L148-164). This has the advantage of more shared code, and we might be able to remove all those horrible hacks once iOS 8 comes out. I certainly hope so, and will write a few more radars.

So, what's fixed in `PSPDFTextView`?

*  When adding a new line, `UITextView` will now properly scroll down. Previously, you needed to add at least one character for this to happen.
*  Scrolling to the caret position now considers `contentInset`. `UITextView` completely ignored this.
*  Typing will also consider `contentInset` and will update the scroll position accordingly.
*  Pasted text will scroll to the caret position.

To enable these fixes, simply use `PSPDFTextView` instead of `UITextView`:

This is working quite well for my use case, but there surely are edge cases where this won't be enough (like when using rich text).
I also tried using the new `textContainerInset` but this didn't work as intended and didn't solve my scrolling problems.

I have to give credit to countless people who searched for the same solution -- this very much was a community-oriented fix. Sadly, this doesn't seem to be a priority for Apple, since it's still broken in iOS 7.1b3.

Please fork the repo and send a pull request if you have any ideas on how to simplify the code or find an even better workaround.
