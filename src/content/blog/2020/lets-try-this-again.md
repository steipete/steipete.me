description: "After a five-year hiatus from personal blogging, I'm reviving this space to share stories that don't fit within Twitter's character limits or on PSPDFKit's corporate blog. This brief introduction marks my return to longer-form technical writing and personal reflections on software development. My aim is to create a dedicated outlet for highlighting interesting experiences, technical challenges, and occasional rants that deserve more depth and permanence than social media allows."

It’s been roughly five years since my last post on [petersteinberger.com](http://petersteinberger.com). A lot has changed since then. The last few years I’ve been fully focusing on [PSPDFKit](https://pspdfkit.com) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/steipete). But there are some stories that are better said in a post — Twitter is a stream and can be difficult to follow. 

On this blog, you can expect some of my highlights, rants, and tech mumblings — basically anything that doesn’t fit on a corporate blog. There are some good stories waiting to be told, so I hope you’ll follow along.
